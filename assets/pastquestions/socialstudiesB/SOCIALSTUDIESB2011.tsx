question: "1b. In what ways can the problems identified in (a) be minimized.",
definition: "The following are four ways in which the problems identified in (a) be minimized:",
options: "\
1. Adoption of scientific methods for exploiting resources: Unscientific mining can minimized by the government ensuring that efficient mining methods are adopted. Unscientific methods of mining, popularly known as “galamsey” often involves indiscriminate digging of trenches which destroys vegetation and farmlands. “Galamsey” operators should be registered and given specific location to operate under strict supervision by the Mineral Commission. The government should ensure that illegal miners use mode machines in mining and their mining activities conform to the standards set by the Minors Commission. The government should ensure that mining companies adopt efficient mining methods like undertaking massive tree planting exercise to revert forest to its original slat after mining activities.\n\n\
2. Construction of hedges and terraces to check soil erosion: Soil erosion can b prevented essentially by maintaining a vegetative cover and constructing hedges .d terraces to control rain water from washing away the top soil. Contour ploughing and provision of good drainage systems will also help reduce erosion. This saves land for other purposes like estate development and agriculture. However, soil erosion can be minimized by applying chemical fertilizer and organic manure to leached. The formation of gullies can be prevented by filling them with stones to prevent erosion. Soil conservation methods Iike planting lemon grass can help to check erosion.\n\n\
3. Polythene waste must be separated from other waste materials before disposal. Separate waste containers with indications as to the type of waste to be put in must provided at vantage points for people to put in their waste materials. This will make it easier for waste materials like plastics, bottle, empty cans, metals, papers, food leftovers etc. to be separated from used polythene bags before disposal.\n\n\
4. Recycling of waste: The government can recycle all solid wastes like raw sewage (human excreta) into bio-gas to generate electricity for domestic use. Sewage, for example, can be turned from their organic matter state into compost and manure for use as fertilizers on the farms. Garbage can also be processed into composed which is later used as organic manure in vegetable production. Polythene waste, cans, waste papers etc. can be recycled as raw materials for industries.\n\n\
5. Encourage proper disposal of waste and toxic materials: Waste management ensuring that the land is not left bear. The government of Ghana should encourage the district assemblies to create forest reserve sites in the communities. The price of LPG should be reduced to encourage many homes to use LPG instead of using firewood and charcoal which lead to deforestation.\n\n\
6. Land degradation can be minimized by the government ensuring that efficient mining methods are adopted. Unscientific methods of Mining methods popularly known as “galamsey” should be avoided or banned. This type of mining often involves indiscriminate digging of trenches which destroys vegetation and farmland. “Galamsey” operators should be registered and given specific location to operate under strict supervision by the Mineral Commission. The government should ensure that illegal miners use modem machines in mining and their milling activities conform to the standards set by the Mineral Commission. The activities of sand winning which have adverse effect on beaches and landscape should be discouraged as they cause sea erosion. Since the beaches serve as tourist attraction, the government should ban sand winning along the beaches. Excessive use of chemicals like fertilizers and pesticides in farming should be minimized since they cause leaching and soil erosion. Instead, organic manure should be used by farmers to improve agricultural production.\n\n\
7. Bush burning: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) should form National Anti-Bush Fire Committee in the districts and local levels of the country. Under the auspices of this Committee, volunteers should be trained by the National Fire Service and formed into volunteer bush Fire Fighting Squads in several villages and towns to teach the local people how to control fire in their locality. Fire belts must be created between farms to check the spread of tires. Modern fire-fighting equipment can be used to put out bush fires promptly.\n\n\
8. Desertification: Desertification is the gradual drying up of once productive land. This problem can be minimized by constructing hedges, terraces to control rain water from washing away the top soil. Woody tree species should be grown in hedges and crops grown in the alleys between the hedges. The roots of the trees will bind the soil together and thus help in checking erosion. Overgrazing results from high livestock density on range of land. To avoid overgrazing, Rural Forestry Programme should be put in place to assist the local people to establish their own woodlots to cater for wood and fodder needs. This can help to control overgrazing and desertification.\n\n\
9. Poor sanitation: Poor sanitation is an environmental problem of national concerns which should be controlled. There is the need to have proper sanitation techniques to control the indiscriminate dumping of refuse. For example, refuse or garbage can be burnt in incinerators at the outskirts of the town. Environmental sanitation in the cities and urban centres can be improved if the Metropolitan, Municipal Councils and Districts Assemblies can provide enough litter boxes or containers at public places so that the pedestrians, traders and hawkers can use them in disposing their waste materials. The dust bin and waste containers which are placed at vantage points should be emptied as soon as they are full.\n\n\
10. Effective waste management programme: Waste management techniques are needed to see the disposal of sewage and liquid waste. Sewage, for example, can be turned from organic matter state into compost and manure for use as fertilizer on farms. In this circumstance it is very necessary that private toilets should be provided in urban centres and especially the rural areas where many individuals cannot afford the provision of their own toilets. This will ensure that people do not defecate along the sea shores and in the bushes. Industrial waste and used polythene bags, plastics and empty cans can be recycled into useful commodities. Industrial waste can be buried deep in the earth like in old abandoned mines or quarries.\n\n\
11. Soil Erosion: Soil has been one of the most abused resources, despite its importance in providing us with food, fibre, wood, gravel and many materials vital to our existence. However, soil erosion can be minimized by applying chemical fertilizer and organic manure to leached soil to boost agricultural production and lesson hunger. The formation of gullies can be prevented by filling them with stones to prevent erosion. Soil conservation methods like planting lemon grass can help to check erosion. Erosion can also be prevented essentially by maintaining a vegetative cover and constructing hedge terraces to control rain water from washing away the top soil. Contour ploughing and provision of good drainage systems will also help reduce erosion. This saves land for other purposes like estate development and agriculture.\n\n\
12. Public Education on environmental problems: Public education is one of the major ways which can be used to let the public know the importance of protecting the environment from industrial pollution and waste management problems. The news media-radio, television and the daily papers can be used to make the general public aware of the need to keep their surroundings clean, desist from dumping solid and liquid waste anyhow and also refrain from burning refuse in residential areas to pollute the air etc. The agency responsible for the protection of the environment, Environmental Protection Agency, should organize public seminars, lectures and workshops in the urban and the rural areas to educate the people on the measures the can take to protect the environment from soil erosion, flooding, noise pollution etc. Religious bodies can use the pulpit to address peculiar environmental problems like indiscriminate throwing of rubbish, faeces etc in their locality. The District Assemblies can also organize weekly environmental sanitation programmes to clean their locality of filth and rubbish. Towns and villages which promote proper environmental sanitation should be rewarded to encourage others to ensure environmental cleanliness.\n\n\
13. Effective enforcement of environmental laws: Sanctions should be imposed on offenders who degrade the environment. People who degrade the environment b throwing rubbish anyhow, urinate and defecate in any place should be made to pay a fine or sentenced to a term of imprisonment not exceeding 1 year or both. In addition to fine or term of imprisonment, an offender convicted for violating environmental laws should be made to pay for the cost of the rehabilitation of the environment (e.g. industries spilling oil in water bodies) as may be ordered by the court. The government should also prosecute people who do not keep their surroundings clean or observe proper environmental sanitation. Sanitary officers"

id: "question2b",
question: "2b. Highlight four effects of broken marriages in your society.",
definition: "The four effects of broken marriages in my society include the following:",
options: "\
1. One effect of broken marriages in no society is street children. When marriages breakdown, the children of the couples are left on their own. In an attempt of the children to fend for themselves, they end up on the streets. The children hawk on the streets with all kinds of items such as mobile phone recharge units, handkerchiefs, “dog chains” and sachet water. These children are sometimes knocked down by moving vehicles on the roads in an attempt to attend to a buyer who is in a vehicle in the traffic. These innocent children especially the girls are exposed to rapists who take advantage of the fact that the girls do not have a place to sleep in the night. Street children are exposed to all kinds of harsh weather conditions especially during the rainfall season. All kinds of diseases such as malaria and cholera attack these children who end up being in the street as a result of broken marriages in the society. In the final analysis it is the society which suffers as the children may die from the diseases.\n\n\
2. Moreover broken marriages in my society may lead to child/juvenile delinquency e.g. burglary, stealing, smoking in my society. When marriages breakdown in my society, the couples no longer take interest in training the children by inculcating in them good moral virtues such as respect for the aged in the community. These children end up joining groups and gangs in the in the communities in which they live or outside their communities. They start with pick pocketing, gambling and cyber fraud. These children finally end up joining armed robbers to carry out their operations. They are sometimes caught in the act and sometimes faced mob action in the community. These children are beaten to death when the police do not come to their rescue. In the long run the society and the country would end up losing these future leaders who would have become members of parliament, president and religious leaders in the society.\n\n\
3. Furthermore, breakdown of marriages in my society may lead to prostitution. The children who are left to their own fate as a result of breakdown of marriages in my society end up becoming commercial sex workers what we normally refer to as “ashawo” in my society. In an attempt for the teenage girls to fend for themselves to survive they end up being prostitutes in the society. They sometimes contract sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV/AIDS. The family members lose and the Government of Ghana also lose the limited resources that could have been used for other sectors of the economy on drugs and food. They tend to put pressure on the inadequate health facilities in the society and they become burden on family members.\n\n\
4. Another effect of broken marriages in teenage pregnancy in my society. These innocent children may engage in irresponsible sex, which may result in teenage pregnancy. These young innocent girls in my society are sometimes lured into sex by irresponsible men in the society. They deceive them with all kinds of gifts and cash. They even go to the extent of promising them to continue their education. They use them and dump them after making them pregnant. These girls end up aborting the pregnancy and sometimes may end up their life as a result of the abortion and its health complications.\n\n\
5. Verbal or physical abuse: Some men are in the habit of beating or physically abusing their wives sometimes to the extent of maiming them or causing serious bodily harm to them. Where such behaviour becomes a common feature of marriage then the woman who is always vulnerable may seek for divorce to avert any bodily harm to her. The se of insulting and offensive language on a partner in public could also ruin a marriage. If a married woman if fond of fighting or abusing the husband, and vice versa this can be a source of problem in the marriage."

id: "question3a",
question: "3a. What is self?",
definition: "Frequent discouragement from family members, peers and elders do not make an individual to develop his capabilities. This is so because if the individual is discouraged, fear builds up in him and this means that he cannot take independent be blame for the decision or action taken. Again, if the individual does not get love and attention from his parents, siblings, teachers and friends this can lower his morale or lower his or her self-image. A child who is not loved by his parents at home develops fear and becomes timid. If there is no one to strengthen or help the child he losses self-confidence and cannot develop his potentialities or capabilities which can make him a responsible person in the society.",
},


{
id: "question3b",
question: "3b. Discuss four factors which inhibit the development of an individual’s capabilities.",
options: "\
1. Financial problems/Poverty: An individual’s capability can be inhibited if he comes from an environment where the poverty level is very high. The individual may therefore lack many thing which he may need to develop his/her capabilities. For example, if an individual wants to learn tailoring he needs a sewing machine and the necessary things that will help him to become a successful tailor or seamstress. The lack of these items will not enable an individual to set up his own tailoring shop after leaning the trade. Again, a student who wants to become either a doctor or an engineer but lacks financial support from his parents may not be able to develop his capabilities because he may not be able to pay his school fees regularly and buy the necessary textbooks which he needs to enable him/her pass his examinations.\n\n\
2. Lack of guidance and counseling: The development of individual’s capabilities can be inhibited if he is not guided to make the right choices in life. For example, if a student is guided by his teachers to choose the right programme and course he may make a choice which may affect his future career and later development in life. Again, a student who is influenced by his parents to read science so that he can become a medical doctor in future while he can do better in General Arts may not be able to achieve his aim of becoming a lawyer if he does not pass his science subjects at the WASSCE exams.\n\n\
3. Inadequate/Low level education and training: Education helps the individual to unearth develop his intellectual /mental and creative abilities. However, low level of education and training makes it difficult for the individual to be equipped with the necessary techniques to reason, create, invent and be able to solve problems. If an individual’s educational level is very low due to financial problems and poor teaching such an individual may not be able to realize his dream of becoming a nurse, teacher, lawyer etc. Again, an individual who wants to become a professional footballer but lacks training facilities like a standard football field, good coach, and a good team cannot develop his capability of becoming a football star like Michael Essien or Asamoah Gyan.\n\n\
4. Unfavourable environment-home, community etc.: The individual cannot develop his capabilities if the environment (home and community) in which he is brought up is unworthy of achieving anything. The reason is that if the individual comes from a home or community where the children do not respect parents and elders it would be very difficult for the individual to acquire descent character and values which the community cherishes. The poor self-image of the individual shows that he cannot take up leadership role in the community.\n\n\
5. Health maters (mental, physical and psychological): Health problems inhibit the individual’s ability to develop his capabilities. An individual who has mental, physical and psychological problems may find it very difficult to develop his capabilities. For example, if a student who wants to be a nurse or doctor develops a mental problem he may have to drop from school to receive medical attention. If this problem continues for a very long time such a student ma have to drop the idea of becoming a nurse or doctor. The same thing applies to a young footballer who has a car accident which affects his hip. Such a person cannot realize his future dream of becoming a football star if he is unable to recover fully from the accident.\n\n\
6. Luck of initiative/self-determination: An individual who cannot think and take decisions independently lacks qualities which can make him develop his capabilities. Such a person cannot act on his own but waits for somebody else to prompt him into action. For example, a student who gets an average mark in mathematics must realize that he has to sit up and learn hard to perform better but not to wait for his parents or teachers to tell him to be serious with his studies. Again, a student who is determined to be a medical doctor in future must learn very hard but not to wait for his parents and teachers to advise him to use his precious time to properly to pass his exams. Distractions from friends can take away his mind from his books unless he has the willpower to remain firm to achieve his aim.\n\n\
7. Inferiority complex: Inferiority complex is a situation where an individual has a very low sell-esteem of himself. The individual does not see himself as capable of doing anything better in life. He feels he cannot adjust himself to suit a picture that is a true copy of him. For example, if a student is very weak academically in class he may find it difficult to associate with the brilliant students in the class for fear that they may know his weakness or regard him as inferior. This may make the weak student to be shy and may not join the bright students during group activities.\n\n\
8. Inability to take risk: A businessman who cannot take-risk cannot be a successful entrepreneur. An individual who fears to try his plans and ideas for fear of failure cannot succeed in business. If an individual fails to take risk and venture into new areas he may not enjoy new opportunities which may come with many benefits. An entrepreneur who fears taking bank loan to expand his business because of the interest he has to pay may continue to operate on a small scale and make small profit. If he risks taking the loan he is likely to expand and reap the benefits of large-scale production.\n\n\
9. Drug abuse, teenage pregnancy, poor role models, peer pressure: Vices such as drug abuse and teenage pregnancy can end a successful career of a very bright student. If a student abuses drugs such as “wee”, cocaine etc. his attention shifts from his books to drugs. Such a student will absent himself from school to join friends who indulge in drugs. He may use his school fees to buy drugs for himself and his friends. Such a student is likely to drop out from school because of his inability to attend classes regularly and pay his school fees. Teenage pregnancy can end the career of a girl who wants to become lawyer. If a school girl comes from a broken home and joins friends who are drop out from school she may be introduced into prostitution as a means of fending for herself. She may become wayward or pregnant thus making it difficult for her to realize her capability of becoming a lawyer."

{
id: "question4",
question: "4. In what five ways has rural-urban migration affected rural communities?",
definition: "Rural-urban migration affects the rural communities in many ways:",
options: "\
1. Loss of labour force: When there is rural-urban migration the young and able- bodied men and women with skills leave for the urban centres. The result is that only the aged men and women who are not active are left in the rural areas. The youth who constitute the bulk of the rural population leave the villages and neglect the farms which employ a large proportion of the proportion.\n\n\
2. Decline in the size of rural markets: The rural-urban migration causes a general fall in size of rural market for goods and services. Producers of farm crops and other allied agro-products like gari, palm products are not encouraged to produce on large-scale. This is due to the fact that young people who can buy the goods produced in the rural areas leave for the urban centres in search of jobs leaving very few people with low purchasing power thereby reducing the size of the market. Low demand for goods and services therefore reduce the size of the market because of the decline rural population as a result of people leaving for the urban towns to find jobs to do.\n\n\
3. Slow pace of rural development: Rural-urban migration may affect the pace of rural development. Development projects which normally are carried out in the rural areas by the local people may not receive serious attention since the youth who undertake such projects like constructing gutters, school blocks, clinics etc. may leave for the urban centres in search of better opportunities. The government may not be encouraged to provide social amenities like markets, KVIP, clinics, electricity etc. for the local people because of their small population which may not qualify the rural-areas for such projects which require much capital to provide.\n\n\
4. Reduction in agricultural production: The loss of labour force which constitutes the young and able-bodied men and women reduces agricultural production and food supply. This means that agro-allied industries, that is, industries which rely on locally produced raw materials will not have enough raw materials like cassava, palm oil, timber, citrus fruits etc. to feed their industries. When agricultural production falls as a result of rural urban migration it will also result in decrease in the production and supply of food crops like yams, cassava, plantain, cocoyam and vegetables etc. to the markets in both the rural areas and urban centres. The scarcity of these basic foodstuffs on the market will force their prices to rise forcing the government to import such foodstuffs from abroad with country’s scarce foreign exchange.\n\n\
5. Disruption of family life which may lead to broken homes: Rural-urban migration has disrupted family life in the rural areas and which has led to broken homes. Many able-bodied young men leave their wives and children behind with the intention of paying them regular visits as soon as they get job. The harsh economic conditions in the urban centres make it difficult for many of the youth who are unskilled to acquire jobs immediately. Many of them therefore fail to remit their wives and relatives at home. There are situations where the family at home may not hear at all from their spouses in the urban centres. In such situations, many women who cannot hear from their husbands in the urban centres for a very long time may ask for separation and eventual dissolution of the marriage. The children left in the rural areas may not have proper supervision and control and may become deviants and adopt bad characters like smoking, stealing, prostitution etc.\n\n\
6. Rural-urban migration may result in adolescence irresponsibility due to improper supervision and control: The attraction of the urban centres encourages the young men to leave for the urban centres leaving behind their children with their aged grand-parents and relatives in the rural areas. Because many of these children grow up under the care of their aged grand-parent and relatives who may be burdened with farm activities the children don’t have good supervision and proper control. They grow up acquiring bad habits such as drinking, smoking and abusing drugs, teenage pregnancy, stealing etc. This behavior results in lawlessness, armed robbery and lack of respect for elderly in the rural areas.\n\n\
7. Family remittances: The youth who flock to the urban centres for employment occasionally send remittances to family members left behind in the rural areas. Such remittances can go long way in improving the living conditions of their family members at home. Part of these remittances could be used to also buy cutlasses, hoes, fertilizers and new seeds for planting and also hire labour to expand their farms and Family houses could also be renovated and rehabilitated. The women could use part of the remittances to undertake petty trading which can help her pay their children’s school fees.\n\n\
8. Provision of social amenities to rural community: The government should provide the rural areas with social amenities such as water, electricity and health centres. The government should also improve the conditions of clinics and health centres and provides social amenities like recreational centres (e.g. cinema halls and community centres), schools, market, toilets (e.g. KVIP) etc. in the rural areas to narrow the differences and gaps in rural and urban living standards. This will in fact reduce the drift of young people from the countryside to the cities in search of better life.\n\n\
9. Provision of leadership in the rural areas: Migrants from urban centres who return to the rural areas could provide leadership for the development of the rural area. These migrants can impart the new ideas and techniques that they had learnt from the big cities to improve their living conditions.\n\n\
10. Inadequate care for the aged: Rural-urban migration takes away the able-bodied young men and women who can work and take care of their aged parents. Many of the migrants because they find it difficult getting jobs are unable to remit their aged parents who need money to seek medical attention and buy drugs. Some of the immigrants cannot also make ends meet and so unable to pay regular visits to the rural area to check on the condition of their aged parents who may not have reliable people at home to care for them. The result is that many aged people in the rural areas may die of hunger or unable to attend hospital when they are sick and will have to rely on unprescribed drugs for treatment which may result in serious complications and eventual death."

},


{
id: "question6b",
question: "6b. Outline four problems that your country may face as a result of her co-operation with other nations.",
definition: "The following are some of the problems that my country Ghana may face as a result of her co-operation with other nations:",
options: "\
1. Financial and technical assistance which may not be in the interest of the country e.g. hardships to the people. For example, the acceptance of International Monetary Funds Loans by Ghana Government tends to bring economic hardships to the country. This tends to promote employment and economic growth in the donor countries mainly.\n\n\
2. Brain drain: My country may face the problem of brain drain. Ghana’s co- operation with developed countries like U.S.A, Britain, Germany, Japan etc. whose economies are well developed attract well trained and skilled personnel like medical doctors, nurses, teachers, pharmacists, scientists, engineers etc. These skilled personnel travel from Ghana to these countries to seek greener pastures. The result of the exodus of skilled Ghanaians to other nation is that Ghana loses its skilled personnel trained with the tax-payers’ money as well as creating shortage of skilled personnel at home.\n\n\
3. Increase in crime e.g. drug trafficking, armed robbery etc.: Fighting cross boarder crime has become a problem to Ghana. There are cases of smuggling of Ghana’s cocoa to Ivory Coast and human trafficking. Ghanaians traffic young girls to Togo and Nigeria to practice prostitution. There are also cases of cars, textiles and other imported goods being smuggled from Togo to Ghana to be sold cheaply. Such smugglers evade taxes which deprive the government of the revenue she needs for economic development.\n\n\
4. Self-reliance is undermined to a large extent: My country depends on donor support for the country’s budget so if such support reduces or delays it may be difficult for my country to carry on with its development projects. Ghana receives foreign investment from Japan, Canada, Britain, USA etc. for her development projects. Such foreign investment does not make the country to be self-reliant but rather makes Ghana to depend so much on foreign capital to finance her socio- economic projects. There is always a problem when the foreign countries withdraw such capital.\n\n\
5. Providing men for peace-keeping duties in other countries: Ghana is faced with the challenge of sending troops to help in conflict resolution and peace building process. The participation of international peace keeping duties in other countries like Lebanon, Liberia, Ivory Coast etc. may impose undue hardships or burden on the national economy. For example, the ECONOMOG operations carried out in sister ECOWAS countries like Liberia were undertaken at an enormous cost to the government of Ghana. Again, peace-keeping duties affect the families who lose their husbands in the course of performing this national assignment. This becomes a problem to the government as these families have to be compensated for the loss of their loved ones.\n\n\
6. Accepting refugees from other countries: Any member country of ECOWAS or African Union is supposed to protect refugees who have fled their homes for sister African countries and other international communities. As a result, Ghana, a member state of ECOWAS and the African Union gives protection to refugees of other countries like Liberia, Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast etc. Such protection is done at a cost as Ghana has to use its scarce resources to provide food, shelter, clothing and health care for the refugees. This puts a strain on the country’s scarce resources.\n\n\
7. Accepting agreement and conventions that may not be in the best interest of countries involved: Ghana faces the problem of accepting agreement and conventions that may not be in the interest of my country Ghana. Many of the agreements that my country signs with International Monetary Fund and Multi-national corporations have strings or conditionalities tied to them. These conditionalities impose undue hardships or burden on the national economy or the people. Aid donors can make it obligatory for the recipient country to buy their capital equipment whether similar equipment of high quality and low price can be bought elsewhere. For example during the Liman Administration the Former Soviet Union supplied Ghana with tractors, which were not environmentally fit for Ghanaian economy due to differences in climatic conditions. Tied aid does not give a free hand to those who manage the economy to pursue objectives exclusively in the interest of the recipient country.\n\n\
8. Effects of donor fatigue when aid is withdrawn: In situations where there are differences between the donor and the recipient countries on political matters or the recipient country may have failed to comply with certain policies of the donor country, then aid may be curtailed or reduced.\n\n\
9. Stifling of local industries through trade liberalization: Importers may over depend on foreign goods to the detriment of locally produced goods. The local entrepreneurs may feel reluctant to engage in any form of investment since not many people will patronize the home-produced goods. The result of this is the collapse of many indigenous enterprises. Many garment industries have collapsed because of the influx of imported used clothing on the market.\n\n\
10. Dumping of inferior/harmful goods: Trade liberalization encourages inflow of imported goods. Unrestricted imports stifle our local industries and entrepreneurship because foreign goods very often out-compete the local ones by way of mass production and lower prices, over-shadowing advertisement and sometimes- superior quality of local goods. Consequently, the local market may be a dumping ground for imported inferior goods e.g. second hand fridges and cars with the resultant environmental pollution. Under import liberalization standardization of goods is open to abuse since the assortment of goods imported escape effective screening for their conformity to national standards. There at times when expired drugs, frozen fish and expired can products are seized and destroyed because they are harmful to the health of the people.\n\n\
11. Payment of due to international bodies: Ghana’s commitment to the cause of other countries has increased in recent times leading to balance of payment problems. For example, Ghana’s participation in economic activities, accepting refugees into the country and her commitment to other international organizations ( IMF, World Bank African Union etc.) means that Ghana has to contribute financially or in material form to these bodies. Since Ghana’s foreign exchange from her international trade has been falling she may not be in a position to pay promptly her dues to these organizations because of her balance of payments deficits."

question: "7b. Explain four conditions for free and fair elections in a democratic state.",
definition: "The following are conditions for free and fair elections in a democratic state:",
options: "\
1. Use of transparent ballot boxes: For free and fair election to prevail in a democratic state the electoral commission must use transparent ballot boxes in all polling stations so that when someone drops his or her ballot paper into the ballot box it will be seen by everyone. This will prevent people from voting double. Again, if the ballot box is not transparent the electorate will not be clear in their conscience if the ballot box is not already stuffed with ballot paper by the ruling government. For the electorate to accept the verdict of the electoral process the ballot box must be transparent and be put in the open for the electorate to see.\n\n\
2. Presence of independent electorate observers: The presence of international observers plays a very important role in helping to ensure the credibility of the election results. The international observers include observers from the United Nations, African Union and Economic Community of West African States. These observers normally arrive early in the country and visit many polling stations to observe the conduct and comment on the elections whether they are free and fair or whether there was rigging of the votes by the ruling government.\n\n\
3. Adequate funds and logistics for the Electoral Commission: The government at should release funds and logistics which the electoral commission needs to undertake its activities. The release of funds and logistics will enable the electoral commission to print ballot papers, provide vehicles and motor-cycles which will enable the personnel of the electoral commission to go to the remotest part of the country to conduct elections. The absence of adequate funds and logistics can affect the conduct and success of free and fair elections.\n\n\
4. Fair demarcation of electoral constituencies: The electoral commission should ensure that the whole country is divided into properly demarcated constituencies, taking into consideration the total population of the country. The demarcation of constituencies must be free from the influence of the ruling government who may use her incumbency to change borders of an electoral area in order to Increase the number of constituencies to favour the ruling government. This exercise will ensure that all interests and the demands of the people are adhered to.\n\n\
5. Avenues for challenging results in courts: For an election to be held in a free and fair manner, the judiciary, notably the courts, must be independent in investigating any electoral malpractices. After the election, any aggrieved party must have the right to challenge the results of the election at the courts. The court should administer justice without fear or favour. The court should also bring to trail any corrupt practices such as rigging of the election, stealing ballot boxes, intimidation by any political party etc. Culprits sent to court should be sentenced accordingly to serve as deterrent to other people.\n\n\
6. Equal access to state resources by the contesting parties: For free and fair elections to take place in a democratic state registered political parties and competing candidates for presidential and parliamentary positions must be given equal access to the mass media, including the state-owned ones. Again equal coverage of all rallies and campaigns must be given to all political parties and their presidential and parliamentary candidates to enable them market their programmes and manifesto to the electorate.\n\n\
7. The use of photo identification cards / registers: The Electoral commission must issue voters identification cards bearing the name and if possible the picture of the voter. This will prevent multiple voting and impersonation. In addition, there must be a good electoral register, which is up to date, devoid of ghost names and double entries. The names of all those dead must be removed from the register to make it clean. This will make the parties involved in the elections to accept the results as a true reflection of the people’s view."

question: "8. Highlight five reasons for the need to save money.",
definition: "The following are some reasons why people need to save money.",
options: "\
1. Contingency fund: Savings serve as a contingency fund which individuals may use to solve emergency problems. Individuals may use contingency fund for unforeseen circumstances like sudden illness, unexpected visitors, accidents, defect in an electrical equipment etc. When an individual receives unexpected visitor and he has a contingency fund he can use it to buy the things he needs to satisfy his visitor. People save money so that anytime they have unexpected problem, like a family member falling sick, they can use it to solve the problem.\n\n\
2. Payment of school fees: Many banks, Insurance Companies and Credit Unions operate education fund for their clients. Monies put into this fund are basically used to pay school fees, buy textbooks, school uniforms and other materials that the client’s ward may need. Some workers may save regularly to enable them use such savings to pay for part-time courses at the universities, polytechnics or to pursue any professional course.\n\n\
3. Payment for investment: Individuals can invest their money in treasury bills, stocks, bonds and shares. An individual can save his money by buying government treasury bills which enables the bearer of the treasury bill to earn interest on the amount used to buy the treasury bill. This type of investment enables the individual to earn interest on his savings which he may later use it to solve any problem he faces. Again, an individual can invest his idle money in buying a share in a company. This makes the one to become a shareholder of the company and can therefore earn interest on his share capital invested in the business.\n\n\
4. To pay for development projects e.g. building project. A worker can save part of his/her income at the bank so that he can use the self-generated fund, that is, personal savings accumulated over the years to start a business which may be a provision shop or a book shop so that when he retires he can manage it. Another person can also save to build a house so that when he retires he has a place to stay with his family.\n\n\
5. To improve living standard: People save for the future because they want to enjoy a better life. With this motive some people plan by putting aside some money so that they could buy a car, and enjoy the same life style on retirement etc. People contribute money to SSNIT so that on retirement they can be paid from the fund that they had contributed whilst working. This monthly payment to retirees enables them to have regular payments which they can use to buy their needs and support their family.\n\n\
6. To initiate community projects: People in a community may save profits they gain from the sale pre-mix fuel, borehole etc. Such accumulated savings can be used to build a school, clinic etc. For example, in many fishing communities the sale of pre-mix fuel generates a lot of profits which they save at the rural banks and later use the money to construct school buildings, clinics and undertake other development projects. Some people also contribute money to community development projects from their past savings. There are many philanthropists in the country who have built schools, clinics, hospitals, police stations, markets etc. for their communities out of their own personal savings.\n\n\
7. Payment of utility fees e.g. water, electricity etc. The individual may save his money with his bank so that at the end of the month upon the standing order given to the bank it will pay his water or electricity bills without going to the Ghana Water Company Ltd. or Ghana Electricity Company Ltd. to pay his bills. This enables the individual to make good use of his savings.\n\n\
8. Payment of medical bills: The individual may save his money at the bank so that when he is in need of money to pay his medical expenses he can easily fall on it. This enables the individual to plan how to use his income and ensure that he makes a regular payment to the account so that when any member of his family is sick he can use such money for their medical bills.\n\n\
9. Security for retirement: The individual should plan for his future by saving for his retirement. At retirement one will not be in active employment and it is necessary that every worker should contribute some money as a means of ensuring a better life. Workers contribute money to the Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT) so that on retirement from active work they can be paid from the fund that they had contributed whilst working. Pensioners enjoy regular pension every month till the worker dies. This enables pensioners to have regular payments which they can use to buy their needs and support their family."

question: "9. Explain five factors that militate against the development of indigenous industries in Ghana.",
options: "\
1. Since entrepreneurs of indigenous industries cannot reduce their cost of production due to the low level of technology they cannot make enough profit to buy modern machines to replace the old machines which break down constantly. Again, many entrepreneurs of indigenous industries lack formal education and as such do not have professional knowledge of modern techniques of managing a business. As such, many indigenous industries do not have enough skilled personal to man such businesses. As result they are always satisfied with the small size of their businesses. Indigenous industrialists do not attend seminar lectures or workshops to improve on their managerial Skills. AS a result they continue to use outdated methods in managing their businesses.\n\n\
2. Limited market size: The size of the market affects the development of indigenous industries because of the low income of the people and inability of indigenous industries to enter the foreign market. The total demand for goods and services depends on the size of the population and Superior and better than similar goods produced in the country which are considered inferior and of poor quality. As a result there is low demand for locally produced goods as against similar goods imported into the country.\n\n\
3. Poor infrastructural facilities: There is inadequate transportation network especially in the form of good roads, bridges, and navigable water bodies, vehicles and rail vans to cart goods between the rural areas and the urban centres. Roads are sometimes impassable due to poor weather conditions, broken bridges, potholes and the non-accessibility of certain areas within the food producing centres. As a result, there are difficulties in transporting farm products goods from the point of production to the consuming and marketing centres. Because of the poor roads, high transport costs are charged by the few drivers, who risk to reach the rural areas safely to bring the foodstuff and raw materials to the buying centres. These transport difficulties greatly contribute to price fluctuations of products produced by indigenous industries on the market.\n\n\
4. High tax rates on industries: A high tax on profit of indigenous industries is a disincentive to investment. Many indigenous industries are not so developed like the foreign industries where they enjoy low tax rates. This therefore enables the foreign industries to produce on a large scale and sell at low prices in the Ghanaian market. In Ghana, the tax regimes are so many and high that they are disincentive to investment and affect the expansion of the businesses. This explains why many indigenous industries like leather making, pottery, kente weaving, palm oil extraction etc. are not developed and operate on a small scale and so cannot introduce new techniques of production.\n\n\
5. Poor working conditions: Poor working conditions of workers of indigenous industries affect their output. If workers of indigenous industries receive low salaries and wages and do not enjoy incentives like allowances, bonuses, subsidized accommodation and lunch this can affect their morale to work harder. This can also lead to lack of commitment and ability to work hard to meet targets. Again, if the machines the workers are working with are poorly maintained due to lack of spare parts this will disrupt the sooth running of the production process. Output will therefore fall and reduce the profit level of the indigenous industries. For example, poor ventilation, lack of necessary inputs (i.e. raw materials) office equipment and lack of canteen services do not encourage hard work. Many indigenous industries do not have good structures where they do their business. As a result many operate in the open so that when it rains they have to close for the day. In this computer age, many indigenous industries do not use computers in their day-to- day activities. There are many indigenous industries which cannot afford to provide for their workers quality tools that can help them increase output.\n\n\
6. Inadequate capital: The banks are unwilling to grant facilities or loans to indigenous industries because they lack collateral security in the form of title deed to land and building, insurance cover etc. to guarantee the loans that the banks would grant them. Since many of the indigenous industries operate on small- scale the returns from their business activities are so small that many of them cannot save at the banks to qualify them for bank loans.\n\n\
7. Competition with from foreign goods: Indigenous industrialists in the country cannot compete with foreign firms because of the government’s trade liberalization policy which has led to the flooding of the domestic market with foreign imported goods. Many of these imported goods like garments, textiles, electrical cables etc. are cheaper in prices and therefore have a wider market than the locally produced goods which are expensive and sometimes of better quality. This situation has made many local ceramic industries in the country to produce below capacity because of the abundance of cheap imported ceramic products on the local market. The mechanism for collecting taxes on imported goods are so lax that the country faces a situation where the market is flooded with so much smuggled and unaccustomed goods that capture the market to the disadvantage of the local producer.\n\n\
8. Inordinate desire or taste of the Ghanaian for foreign goods: The Ghanaian has a high taste foreign goods like pomade, textiles, garments, electronic gadgets etc. than the locally produce ones. This is because the Ghanaian has the impression that goods imported into the country are\n\n\
9. Inadequate raw materials: Many indigenous industries do not have regular source of raw materials. This may be due to the irregular rainfall pattern which does not allow the regular supply of raw materials like cotton for the local weaving industry throughout the year. The excessive cutting of timber for export has made it difficult for wood carvers to get wood on regular basis to produce their carvings. Almost every available land is now used for building or other purposes therefore making it difficult for potters to get the right clay for their pottery industry.\n\n\
10. Inadequate equipment and spare parts: Many indigenous industries use old tools and machines for which spare parts apart from being expensive are difficult to come by. Where the spare parts are available their prices are very prohibitive. The imported equipment and spare parts are not enough to meet the demand of the large numbers of people who are engaged in the indigenous industries. people’s incomes. The small population of our villages and towns does not allow for large-scale production as there will be few people available to buy the goods if they are produce on a large scale. Since the indigenous industries cannot produce on a large scale due to their small size they are not able to satisfy the home market and so they cannot enter the foreign market as well. The income per head of population is low and as such consumers are unable to buy many goods that are produced by the local industries. The patronage of goods produced by indigenous industries is small hence the size of the market."

id: "question10",
question: "10. In what five ways can negative work attitudes affect business concerns in Ghana?",
definition: "Five negative work attitudes that affect business concerns in Ghana are:",
options: "\
1. Low productivity: The aim of every business concern is to increase output to make profit. If workers fail to work harder and exhibit positive behaviours at work there will be low productivity. Some of these negatives attitudes that affect their productivity include lateness, laziness, irregularity etc. For example, if workers do not go to work on time, but use working hours for their personal business and close from work earlier than the normal time, workers cannot achieve their output target and consequently productivity will reduce.\n\n\
2. Loss of production time: One of the effects of negative attitudes at work is the unnecessary loss of productive time. Any time spent unnecessarily cannot be regained. Lateness to work, sleeping at work, leaving the work place earlier than is required, laziness, waste of working hours on conversation and receiving visitors, absenteeism etc. lead to loss of productive time. There are some workers who use productive time to work lotto therefore either abandoning or using little time for the work assigned them. Again, if a worker is supposed to work for eight hours to enable him stitch five hundred books but comes to work late such a worker will not be able to finish the work assigned him or he may do the work in a shoddy way thereby wasting productive time and reducing productivity.\n\n\
3. Low quality products: The production of low quality products is the result of laziness, pilfering, absenteeism, lateness to work, sleeping at work etc. A worker who shows this negative attitude at work will not perform better at the work assigned him. For example, a block maker can produce one thousand blocks of good quality using 50 bags of cement to produce twenty blocks per bag of cement. This worker can also produce one thousand blocks of poor quality by using more sand and less cement (say 40 bags of cement) thereby stealing 10 bags of cement which he may sell. In the end, the quality of blocks produced cannot be compared with the quality blocks the employer expects the worker to produce.\n\n\
4. Delay in meeting targets: Negative work attitude such as waste of working hours on conversation and receiving of visitors, lateness to work, laziness etc. affects quality of work as well as the smooth running of the business. For example, every teacher has a syllabus from which he makes his scheme of work which he has to follow to teach. If a teacher persistently absents himself from class he is not likely to complete the syllabus and the scheme of work which he has prepared to teach his students. This means that the students will not be able to finish the syllabus for the years work and consequently their performance at WASSCE will be very poor.\n\n\
5. Loss of revenue: If the business enterprise is not able to meet target set due to negative attitudes such as laziness, pilfering, lateness etc this will lead to low output and hence reduce profits. If output is low, the business will not be able to make enough profits which can be used to pay for its loans taken from the banks. In this case, low profits mean that the workers’ salaries can be delayed and some workers laid off. Since sales of the Company’s product are low due to low output there will be loss of revenue to the business.\n\n\
6. Poor conditions of work: Another effect of negative work attitude that affects business concerns in Ghana is poor conditions of work. The net effect of poor conditions of work is low output and low profit which leads to low salary/wages. If workers output is low it leads to low revenue from goods sold resulting in low profit to the business. This in effect means that workers cannot enjoy better working conditions like increase in salaries and wages, bonuses, free transport and lunch. Poor conditions of work can lower the morale of workers and affect their ability to put in their best in the work they have been employed to do.\n\n\
7. Industrial unrest: Negative work attitude like malingering, lateness to work, pilfering etc. affects quality of work as well as smooth running of the business. Workers may complain about the poor conditions like poor wages and salaries and the absence or stoppage of other incentives like bonuses, allowances, free transport and free lunch. Management may respond by making workers aware of the poor sales the business is making which is affecting the businesses level of profits and the possibility of reducing the work force. If management’s fail to meet the demands of the workers by improving their working conditions this may lead to industrial unrest. This will disrupt the smooth running of the business and thus lower its productivity.\n\n\
8. Disruption of smooth running of the business: Industrial unrest, lateness to work, absenteeism, waste of working hours on conversation and receiving mobile phone calls can disrupt the smooth running of the business if increased interdependence within and among work is needed work is needed to facilitate production. In a business concern where the work is broken down into stages like book production, textile industry etc., if a worker fails to come to work on time the production process can be seriously affected since each worker has been trained for a specific aspect of the production procession. For example, if there is an industrial unrest in the textile industry, production process will breakdown. Again, if there is a strike in the oil palm plantation this will affect the soap manufacturing industries since the will not get raw materials like palm oil to make soap and other products. High labour turn-over as a result of poor salaries can also affect the sooth running of the business concern.\n\n\
9. They will be unattractive to investors: Investors will invest in a business which they hope to make profit so that they could pay back the capital invested in the business. A business will not be attractive to foreign investors or local investors if the workers sleep at work, pilfer the business materials, come to work late, use working hours to work lotto and receive phone calls. Such negative attitudes will result in low productivity. With low productivity, the profit margin will fall and the management of the business cannot entice investors to invest their capital in the business.\n\n\
10. May lead to collapse of the business concern: Negative work attitudes such as laziness, lateness to work, absenteeism, sleeping at work etc., affect the quality of work and lower output of workers. This will lead to reduction in the profit margin of the business and make it difficult for it to reap the capital or money invested in the business. If both output and profit of the business continue to fall below a level management will not be able to cover its total cost of production and operational cost. In fact, if the business is marking losses and cannot pay its fixed cost of production like rent, electricity, salaries of senior officers etc. the management may be forced to close down the business. Again, if the business cannot have money to buy raw materials to produce because it is"
