question: "1. Examine the view that in marriage greater responsibility is placed on the husband than the wife.",
definition: "Students should begin their argument by stating that: ‘In marriage greater responsibility is placed on either the husband or the wife’. So you can argue for or against the motion. If you argue in favour of the man or the woman you have to conclude your argument by stating that ‘for a successful marriage, the couple supplements each other’s responsibility’",
options: "\
1. The lead of the family: The husband is the head and breadwinner of the family; he provides the material needs of the family.        Ile therefore performs such responsibilities like provision of food, clothing, shelter. He works hard to get enough money to provide these basic necessities of life.\n\n\
2. Protection of the family: The husband protects the family both spiritual and physical. Because of the physical strength of the husba    nd, he is expected to protect his family against any physical attack or harm by other people. He defends the family members from any outside attacks. As spiritual head of the family, he occasionally pours libation to ask the gods to protect the family. He also makes sure that the children go to church.\n\n\
3. Role Model: The husband is expected to set good example for the family members to follow. He must be honest, tolerant, fair, firm and tr   uthful in all his dealings with the family members. The husband is also expected to ensure discipline in the family. Ile should check waywardness among the children and ensure moral training of the children so that they develop good character from undesirable external influences.\n\n\
4. Maintenance of Law and Order: It is the duty of the father to maintain law and order at home. He therefore settles disputes within the fami ly by solving quarrels between the children and between the children and their mother. He sees to it that there is peace and harmony in the family.\n\n\
5. Sexual Satisfaction: The husband satisfies the sexual and other emotional needs of the wife. The husband ensures that her wife gets the sexu    al satisfaction that she needs so that together with her they produce children into the family. The role of procreation ensures the continuity of the family line. The husband gives love and affection to the family members. He comforts the wife when she is sad and solves her problems to make her happy.\n\n\
6. Financial commitment: The husband provides the financial needs of the family. He is usually the one who pays all the bills, that is, payment of     school fees, rent, donations, water and electricity bills. When a member of the family is sick, it is the husband who has to take the one to the hospital and settle the hospital bills.\n\n\
7. Commitment to nuclear and extended family: The husband is obliged to help his nuclear and extended family members when they are in need. He therefor   e cares for his extended family members. He has to send money home for the upkeep of his father and mother and make sure that he takes care of at least one or two of the extended family members in school or comes to stay with him. It is also the responsibility of the husband in seeing to the financial needs of his in- laws. He has to help his wife’s relatives especially the parents of the woman to show that he is grateful to them for having given their daughter to him in marriage.\n\n\
8. Social Obligations: It is the responsibility of the husband to attend funerals with the wife. Since the man is the head of the family, he is expected     o be present at naming and marriage ceremonies involving family members to ensure that the traditional aspects of these ceremonies are properly done. Since it is the man who has to pour libation, it makes the man’s presence very necessary and important at family and other social gatherings. In conduction, the woman also performs some responsibilities such as farming, trading, moral training and discipline, childbirth, domestic services and satisfies the sexual needs of the husband. However, for a successful marriage, the couple supplements each other’s responsibility."

id: "question2",
question: "2. Why do countries conduct periodic population census?",
definition: "The following are some of the reasons why countries conduct periodic population census:",
options: "\
1. Population census aids development or economic planning embracing all regions and districts of the country: The government needs to obtain adequate and relevant population statistics of the country for planning purposes. The data will enable government to undertake economic and educational planning for the people. The government can plan for education, health, housing, transportation, industries and other social services.\n\n\
2. Population census forms an objective basis for the distribution of a country’s resources to all regions and districts. By analysing the results of population census, the government is able to provide social and economic infrastructure like education, health, housing, roads, industries, power, bridges etc. throughout the country on an even basis. Revenue allocation among the regions and districts for development programmes is based partly on the population of the regions and districts.\n\n\
3. Population census aids the formulation of policies towards the size of population, and its rate of growth, Population census enables the government to assess the growth rate of the population. If a country’s rapid population growth is due to high birth rate, the government can introduce population control measures like Family Planning which will enable families to space their births and have children when they want them. The government can also formulate policies which will bring about rapid economic development in the form of increased productivity from the agricultural and industrial sectors, which can help to solve the undesirable effects of rapid growth of population like food shortages.\n\n\
4. Population census aids the formulation of policies towards migration. Migration from the rural areas to the urban centres accounts for half of urban population expansion. By analysing the results of population census, the government can control rural-urban migration by establishing rural industries and providing the rural area with social amenities like electricity, pipe-borne water, hospitals, schools, recreational and entertainment facilities.\n\n\
5. Population census forms the basis for delimitation of constituencies especially for election purposes. Results of a population census will assist the government in the demarcation/delimitation of electoral boundaries or constituencies. This will enable the government to know the constituencies needed by each region / district for parliamentary representation. It also provides information for the country to be divided up for administrative purposes.\n\n\
6. Population census forms the basis for the importation of goods and services: The age composition of a country’s population will determine which items to be imported. If the numbers of young people are many in the country, the government will import goods like shoes, dresses, electronics, fridges, cars etc.\n\n\
7. Population census helps demographers (i.e. experts who research into population matters) in their continuous study/ research into population matters. Population census helps the government to obtain accurate demographic characteristics of the people living in the country e.g. sex, age, religious denominations etc.\n\n\
8. For purposes of foreign aid: Population census forms the basis for the amount of foreign grants, aid and investments flowing to a country. Foreign countries and other world bodies need information on the population when planning technical or economic assistance for the country. Many of the aid- giving agencies are influenced by the needs of countries as expressed by the number of people, which also indicate the size of markets and therefore influence foreign investment. Population figures also provide a basis for contributions to such organisation as the UN, ECOWAS and A.U.\n\n\
9. To determine the size of population of a country: Population census provides an accurate statistics of the number of people living in the country. This will enable the government to know the characteristics of the people e.g. the size of the family, the age, sex, and occupations of the people and the amount of living space they have and so on. The standard of living in a country is measured with many factors among, which is per capita income. There is the need to divide the total population by the Gross Domestic Product.\n\n\
10. Population census helps the government to obtain figures on the working population, dependency load and unemployment. It helps the nation to know those in school and the dependants so as to plan the budget well."

question: "3. Discuss four measures that can be taken to ensure the protection of fundamental human rights in Ghana.",
definition: "The measures that can be taken to ensure the protection of fundamental human rights in Ghana include the following:",
options: "\
1. Entrenched clauses in Fundamental Human rights: The fundamental human rights must be clearly stated in the constitution and entrenched. The clauses on Fundamental Human rights are normally entrenched in Written Constitution. For example, in the 1979 Constitution of Ghana, the clauses covering the Fundamental Human Rights of the citizens were entrenched in the written constitution. This provision helps to safeguard Fundamental Human Rights because whenever such rights are entrenched, their amendment procedure become complex, hence the government cannot easily and quickly change them to suit its whims and caprices.\n\n\
2. Independence Of Judiciary: The existence of an independent, bold, impartial and incorruptible judiciary in a state helps to protect the rights and liberties of the citizen by ensuring fair adjudication of cases. An independent judiciary ensures that the executive should not interfere with the work of the judiciary. The Judiciary Council should be given the freedom to appoint judges based on merit. The existence of provisions like judicial Review, which enables the judiciary to examine all laws passed by the legislature and actions taken by the Executive and declare some as null and void helps to safeguard citizens’ rights and liberties against abuses.\n\n\
3. Ombudsman and Human Rights Commissioner: The establishment of Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice in all the Regions and Districts will help to protect human rights from being abused. The creation of the office of the Ombudsman, who would listen to the grievances of citizens against ministers, public corporations, local government and other statutory bodies helps to safeguard citizen rights. The Ombudsman normally listens to grievances of citizens against public officials, carries investigation and seeks redress.\n\n\
4. Political Education: Citizens are able to defend their rights and liberties when they are well educated on their rights and liberties. Knowledge of one’s rights helps to keep a person alert against Encroachment or interference on his rights. There should be institutions like N.C.C.E. in all the district, regional and rural levels to educate the public on their rights. Educating people on the institution and observance of principles such as the Rule of Law, Separation of power, Checks and Balances in a state will go a long way in checking violation of citizens’ rights. For instance, the principle of rule of law would ensure equality before the law.\n\n\
5. Formation of association: People should fight for and defend their rights through the formation of association. Associations like Trade Union, Ghana National Association of Teachers (GNAT), and National Association of Graduate Teachers (NAGRAT) are able to fight and defend the rights of their members in terms of better conditions of service.\n\n\
6. Freedom of mass media: There should be freedom of mass media so that they can peruse their activities without any harassment form the government in power. The media should not be victimized for criticising government (but criticisms should be objective/constructive). The existence of bold and independent press helps safeguard citizens’ right from being encroached upon by the government. The press normally criticises government policies that are aimed at infringing on the citizens’ rights. The Mass Media Commission should promote and ensure the freedom and independence of the media. The existence of an independent Mass Media Commission, which is free from government control, that would look after the promotion appointment, dismissal and conditions of service of the press, helps to make the press free and bold to criticize bad policies of the government that infringe on citizen’s rights without fear and favour.\n\n\
7. International Organisations: International organizations fighting for the enforcement of human rights, for example Amnesty International should be allowed to report breaches of these rights. Members of International Organisations like the U.N.O, O.A.U, Amnesty International, and so on, help states to uphold and respect the rights and liberties of their citizens. These bodies have various charters on human rights such as the UNO charter on Human Rights, Amnesty International charter, European Human Rights charter and the African charter on Human Rights. These bodies often condemn states that infringe on the rights of their citizens. The reports of these bodies create on unfavourable world which constitutes a check on any regime in power to avoid infringing on citizens’ rights. For example, Amnesty International always condemns political leaders who imprison or detain their opponents without trial.\n\n\
8. An Effective Police: To ensure the liberties of citizens, there is the urgent need for an effective police system in order to ensure effective enforcement of law and order. The police must ensure fair investigations of cases. There must also be fair trial of cases. Non-governmental organizations should inspect prisons by at regular intervals to ensure that prisoners are well treated and receive their complaints. Law enforcement agencies should be trained and equipped to handle cases of Human Rights abuses.\n\n\
9. Legal aid should be provided and for free."

{
id: "question4",
question: "4. Discuss the factors which hinder the development of one’s capabilities",
options: "\
1. Lack of Encouragement: A child cannot realise his capabilities if he lacks encouragement from home, community, friends etc. If parents do not have better personal relations with their children or if there is no warm family atmosphere for the children to talk freely about their problems both at home and at school then the children may develop fear in them and cannot have their potentialities developed. If the child does not get better food, clothing, shelter, protection and enough rest to enable him pursue his academic studies such a child is likely to be dull in school. Some parents do not reward their children by way of a pat on the shoulder for doing well in an examination or doing a household chore nicely. This may easily discourage the child from performing better next time. Poor parental control can also affect a child’s capabilities. Some parents are always absent from home and therefore cannot assist their children in their studies. Such neglect can affect the child’s academic performance since he may divert the time for his studies to visit friends. The wider community may not also acknowledge the potentialities of a child who shows concern about the environment by seeing to it that his surroundings are clean. If such a child is not recognised and encouraged by the community stakeholders he may gradually loose interest in his concern for the environment and direct his energies into other unproductive activity.\n\n\
2. Societal Problems: Societal problems like drug abuse, teenage pregnancy, poor role model can easily affect one’s capabilities. For example, a student who indulges in drugs cannot have time for his studies since he will always be thinking about how to get money to buy drugs. Such a student is likely to perform poorly in his examinations: Teenage pregnancy may affect a girl’s education since her schooling may be curtailed and so cannot realise her aim of being a medical doctor in future. Some children imitate the bad behaviours of adults in the society. If a child has a role model who is a smoker, thief or drug addict such a child is likely to take over the bad character of the adult and this can affect the capabilities of the child. Such a child cannot grow up to be a responsible person in the future.\n\n\
3. Financial Problems: Financial problems may affect one’s ability to achieve one’s capabilities in life. A child who comes from a home where the parents are financially poor may not be able to get the necessary financial assistance to buy books, pay school fees, buy school uniform and other items necessary for his education. Such a child may always be sacked to collect his school fees or examination fees and may end up being a truant: He may not therefore be able to complete his education or continue it. There are many young men and women roaming the streets who as a result of financial problems failed to complete or continue their education. Many youth cannot therefore realize their capabilities of becoming a teacher, nurse, engineer etc.\n\n\
4. Health Problems: Many people have not been able to achieve their capabilities because of poor health. If a child is a sickler he cannot perform very well in sports even though he may show signs of interest in it. Children, who are physically handicapped e.g. cripples ,are not usually offered the same opportunity for advancement by their parents or by the state as other children and as such sound children look down upon physically challenged children as social misfits. Eye problems can als affect a child’s academic performance. If such a child cannot get financial assistance from his parents to go for medical check-up he may stop schooling. There are many children who as a result ofill-health have to stop schooling thereby making it very difficult for them to achieve their capabilities.\n\n\
5. Lack of Education: Education and training help to develop one’s capabilities. However, when education fails to equip one with the necessary techniques to create, invent and solve problems, one cannot reason or think rightly for one’s self. If a child does not get sound education to develop his mental or intellectual abilities he cannot achieve his aim of becoming a pilot or a surgeon. Lack of training in carving, singing, drawing, carpentry, dressmaking cannot make one attain the highest level of achievement. A singer who does not practice constantly cannot sing to the admiration of his/her audience. In same vein an artist who lacks training in modern technology in drawing may not be able to produce good work.\n\n\
6. Lack of guidance and counselling: Guidance and counselling helps to discover and develop one’s capabilities. Lack of guidance and counselling will make one unable to make sound and realistic plans and successfully carry them out. Without guidance and counselling one cannot change one’s negative self-image. For example, if a student has a low image of himself or is shy or he cannot ask questions in class or participate in group discussions. Through guidance and counselling a student can overcome his shyness. Children who lack guidance and counselling either from the home or school may not know the dangers of smoking, drinking, taking drugs, on their health and academic performance and also their future life.\n\n\
7. Government Policies: The government may pursue bad economic policies which may not help an individual to achieve his capabilities. For example, if the government does not pursue sound economic policies which will make parents have sufficient incomes then they will not be able to feed, clothe, pay their children’s schools fees, buy uniforms and books. This is likely to affect the child’s academic performance and his ability to achieve his capabilities. Also if the government’s economic policies result in unemployment or retrenchment of workers such a situation will make many people financially poor and unable to take good care of themselves and their children in school. The effect on children is that many of them may have to stop school or may not be able to further their education. Such children may not be able to achieve their desired goal in life or their potentialities.\n\n\
8. Inability to take risk and adventure: Another factor which hinders the development of one’s capabilities is the inability of one to take risk and venture into new areas. If an individual docs not have courage in whatever that he does and is afraid of taking risks such a person may not be able to realize his capabilities. A businessman who cannot take risk in business may not be to achieve his capabilities. A mediocre businessman may not be able to expand his business by talking a loan from the bank or change his line of production to increase his profits. 9.Inconsistent Educational Policy: Lack of facilities like school building, workshops, recreational grounds and materials for practical work are serious hindrance to effective teaching and learning. Some schools also lack adequate equipment and instructional materials such as library books, textbooks and science equipment. Inadequate supply of textbooks and science equipment affect the performance of teachers and students. In such a situation, a teacher who is not resourceful and uses old teaching notes and scanty ideas picked from one reference books will have his students not performing well in an external examination. Change of textbooks and programmes affect the student’s capabilities. For example, in basic schools the Government replaced Cultural Studies and Social Studies Textbooks with Religious and Moral Education and Environmental Studies Textbooks respectively. This change in textbooks can easily affect the performance of students by making the weaker one’s not doing well in their examination.\n\n\
9. Inferiority Complex: he’s capabilities can be affected by inferiority complex. Some people have the feeling of inferiority or worthlessness and therefore always think of their weaknesses rather than their strength, For example, a student who has no confidence in him / herself cannot fully achieve his / her goal in life. Some students consider themselves dull and weak academically in class and therefore do not want to strive to overcome such weakness such inferiority complex can affect the child’s capabilities.\n\n\
10. Lack of Personal Initiative: One cannot achieve his capabilities if one does not have a sense of vision or set goals and strive to achieve them. For example, if one is a leader and cannot initiate moves and ideas to be followed by others and prepared to take risk such a leader is not likely to achieve the results that he expects."

{
id: "question5",
question: "5. Discuss four causes of indiscipline among the youth and suggest solutions to these problems.",
definition: "Suggested solutions must be linked to problems raised Some of the causes of indiscipline among the youth include the following:",
options: "\
1. Lack of parental control: Lack of parental control is one of the causes of falling moral standards in our society. The breakdown of traditional family life with its sanctions and controls through divorce, separation of parents and working parents has a negative effect on the children. Teenage girls who don’t experience parental control may be exposed to sexual abuse. Due to the inability of some parents to provide for their teenage girls physically and materially, these girls become easy prey for males. Most girls who yield to sexual advances from male counterparts do so because they are promised some form of reward in exchange for sex.\n\n\
2. Influence of drugs: The exposure of the youth to drugs and alcoholic beverages either at school or home has negative influence on the youth. The use of drugs to study or get more energy has made many teenagers to become drug dependent. To demand more drugs one needs money and this has made many youth to resort to stealing, or drug pushing or peddling which has landed many youth in jail. It is also not uncommon to find many youth becoming drug addicts and resorting to rape and drunkenness. Many youth have become insane and even died through excessive use of drugs.\n\n\
3. Peer influence/pressure: The youth learn a lot from their peers who exercise much influence on them. The youth copy the behaviour of their peers and as such some few teenagers want to be the ‘odd one out’ in many, a group and a number of young people start to take drugs for this reason.\n\n\
4. Infiltration of foreign culture: There is nothing at all wrong with selective cultural borrowing for the enrichment of our traditional culture. However, *he exposure of many Ghanaian youth to foreign culture through contacts, travels etc. has made many youth to acquire foreign way of life like wearing foreign dresses, hair styles, hair cuts and some men wearing ear rings and plaiting their hair. These foreign cultures are unacceptable to our way of life and have made many youth to look down on the culture of the country as outmoded.\n\n\
5. The Influence of the media: The youth learn are easily influenced by what they hear, see and read from the electronic and print media. The influence of cincma, TV, video, magazines, pornographic literature influences the normal lives of the youth. The mass media is very helpful in promoting the culture of people. In recent times the proliferation of cinema and video houses which show crime and sex related films have contributed to the upsurge of crimes among the youth in the country. The presence of foreign magazines and pornographic literature on the open market has also contributed to the increase in rape, armed robbery and teenage pregnancy in the country,\n\n\
6. Limited religious education in the schools and homes; There is inadequate religious and moral education in many of our schools. There is little emphasis on religious and moral education in many of our schools and homes hence many of the youth show deviant behaviour. Schools these days do not put emphasis on the need for children to go to church since many of the schools are now run by the government and private proprietors, The emphasis on academic education has relegated to the background religious education in our schools. Where the parent does not go to church, the child is likely to grow up without taking religion serious. The falling moral standards among the youth of today may also be due to the fact that many parents do not have time to teach their children moral values from the Bible which can help shape the lives of the youth.\n\n\
7. Deviation from traditional moral values: The break down of the traditional control of the youth in the rural areas has led many youth to travel to the urban areas in search of jobs. In the urban areas many of the youth are unable to get jobs and thus become unemployed and start indulging in anti-social lives like prostitution, stealing, rape and drug abuse. The breakdown of traditional values, norms, taboos and other social sanctions such as ostracising a rapist or a thief which were employed to prevent these abuses are no longer in force especially in the urban areas.\n\n\
8. Negative influence from the home e.g. drunken parents, immoral wives / husbands: The youth tend to copy the irresponsible behaviour of adults easily when they engage in activities such as sex, smoking, use of hard drugs etc. The moral behaviour of many parents have sunk so low that many youth have been influenced by such behaviour. For example, in many homes parents openly drink and smoke before their children. Some husbands even go to the extent of beating their wives and some women also use very bad language when fighting. Children copy this behaviour from the homes. Where parents lead immoral lives like the husband going after other men’s wives or young girls and the wife going after other men, the children from such homes can easily fall prey to unsuspecting men and can easily become pregnant.\n\n\
9. Crave for material things: The youth are not satisfied with what their parents provide for them and because of the lust for material things, they are easily lured into immoral activities. For example, the girls become prostitutes so that they can get more money to satisfy their many needs. The boys join gangs to steal in order to satisfy the needs of the girl friends,\n\n\
10. Unemployment: Many youth are unemployed because of lack of jobs. Since there are fewer jobs available in the country it is difficult for all the youth to be employed. As a result, many of the youth become idle since they lack employable skills, which firms require for employment, Many youth in the urban centres are employed as messengers, house helps, or sell things by the roadside. The youth therefore resort to criminal acts and indulge in social vices like stealing, prostitution, drug abuse, and etc. \n\nThe suggested solutions to the problems raised are as follows:\n\n\
1. Control of the media, video magazine and pornographic literature: The sale of pornographic material and the screening of sex related and rime films on our televisions, cinema and video houses contributes immensely to sexual abuse in our society and must be stopped. Such material like films and video tapes must be censored before they are allowed to be screened on our televisions and video houses. Pornographic literature of any kind must be banned since they contribute to sex abuse in the country.\n\n\
2. The teaching of family life education both in school and at home: Family life and sex education should be included in the school curricula to enable the adolescent to be taught topics like adolescent and adult sexuality, the individual’s growth in relation to the family as well as his/her responsibilities and duties to the society. The inclusion of the family life and sex education in the school curricula will enable the teacher to perform his/her duties as a parent and guardian effectively, By so doing, the children can also get access to the facts of life, which are being denied them by their parents in the home. It should be noted that the issues of family life education is the collective responsibility of parents, teachers and the community. There should be more be more social welfare clinics which will take interest in the plight of children of divorced or separated parents.\n\n\
3. Through guidance and Counselling by teachers, parent and religious bodies: The government should encourage religious and moral education in the schools. Teachers who are responsible for Guidance and Counselling in our schools should encourage the school children to use their leisure time profitably through such activities as outdoor games and community service projects. School children should also be encouraged to join schools clubs and societies organized on school campuses so that they can channel their youthful energies in organising drama, quiz, debate, symposium etc. Many social commentators and religious heads are of the opinion that the decline in moral standards of the people may be attributed to the little control that religious bodies have on school’s they previously controlled.- It is therefore argued that if religious education is taught in the schools, the children will learn a lot from the Biblical stories or the Quran and lead high moral lives.\n\n\
4. Enforcement of school rules and regulations: The school authority should enforce discipline in our schools and make school children conform to school rules and regulations, it is necessary that, children who break school rules and regulations are given the appropriate punishment which will serve as deterrent to other school children.\n\n\
5. Availability of jobs for the youth : The government and private entrepreneurs should provide jobs for the youth after completing school. This will make them channel their youthful energies into productive activities which will enhance their standard of living.\n\n\
6. Exemplary life from adult: The adult should lead life worthy of emulation by the youth. The older generation should be of better example to the youth and set leadership roles or be role models to the youth. The adult should let the youth know that if they say smoking, drinking, womanising, and many other social vices which they speak against are bad then, they should ensure that the youth do not see them doing what they had spoken against.\n\n\
7. Provision of healthy recreational facilities: There should be adequate provision of recreational facilities like zoos, places of entertainment, parks, and places for picnics controlled by responsible adults, cultural centres etc. The youth should also be encouraged to form social clubs at school and join other social clubs when out of school like the Red Cross, Boys Scout, Girls Guide etc. so that they can uge their leisure time more profitably.\n\n\
8. Good parental care and control of the youth: Parents should show love, care and understanding for their children. Parents should also provide the needs of the youth so that they do not seek assistance from their friends. Parents should also advise the youth to choose friends of good character and also not allow their friends to influence them.\n\n\
9. Teaching cultural and moral values of the people: The youth should be taught to respect their elders and show concern for the aged. The youth should also be taught to appreciate the need to know the culture of the people so that they can grow into responsible citizen."

question: "6. How do traditional festivals portray the cultural heritage of Ghanaians?",
definition: "Traditional festivals portray the cultural heritage of Ghanaians in the following ways: First, traditional festivals portray the history of the Ghanaian people. Almost all the ethnic groups in the country have festivals, which they celebrate at different times of the year to remember significant events in the life of the people. These festivals, some of which are Fetu Afahye, Aboakyir, Homowo, Adae, and Odwira are celebrated for various reasons. For example, the Ahoba festival of the Gomoa people is celebrated to give thanks to the ancestors and the gods for delivering them from a dreadful disease. Also, the Ewes celebrate the Hogbetsotso festival to commemorate the time their forefathers ran away from their cruel chief Agokoli. Others celebrate traditional festival to give thanks to the supreme God for giving them good harvest. Through traditional festivals people get to know why festivals are celebrated in certain parts of the country. Second, traditional festivals portray the cultural heritage of Ghanaians by demonstrating the institution of chieftaincy. During traditional festivals the-chief sits in state with his elders to receive homage from his subjects. The regalia of the chief depicts the importance of chicftaincy institution and the position the chief holds in the traditional set up of the people. The unity and solidarity of the people are seen on occasions like festivals where the stools and skins used by the chiefs serve as unifying force. Third, drumming and dancing are used extensively in traditional festivals and thus help to portray the cultural heritage of Ghanaians. Drumming is an important aspcct of Ghanaian culture. Drum sets like Atumpan, Fontonfrom etc. are used during traditional festivals to invoke the appellations of the Chief and important personalities during festivals. Most of the songs that are sung go with drumming and dancing. Some of the dances that go with drumming are adowa, agbadza, kundum and Kete. Fourth, traditional festivals mark the beginning and the end of the traditional year. During traditional festivals, the chiefs and people offer sacrifices as a thank offering to the traditional deities and ancestral spirits for guarding and guiding them throughout the year. They also ask for blessing and protection in their undertaking in the coming year through the pouring of libation. Five, traditional festivals portray the cultural heritage of Ghanaians by ushering in of new food. During traditional festivals some ethnic groups in the north meet and give thanks to their ancestors for good harvest (eg. yam, festival). This strengthens the bond of unity between the living and the dead. Such periods are also used as customary purification of the people and the land for good yield in the next season. Six, traditional festivals portray the cultural heritage of Ghanaians through religious beliefs and practices. During festivals libation is poured by the chief’s linguists to ask the gods and ancestral spirits blessings and protection for the people. Also stools and regalia are washed with white red clay. Food and drinks are offered to the gods by traditional and family heads to serve as ritual cleansing. Festivals also serve as a period of renewal of vows to the ancestors and to remember the dead. Seven, traditional festivals portray the cultural heritage of Ghanaians through traditional costume. The dressing of Ghanaians portrays their identity and culture, During festivals, chiefs in the Southern Ghana put on Kente cloth while chiefs in the Northern and Upper Regions wear the traditional smock and batakar. Drums like Atuppan and Fontonfrom are used to play praise words for chiefs and other important dignitaries who attend festivals. Also during festivals, the chief is carried in a palanquin with a traditional umbrella towering over him. These material cultures like costume, drums, palanquins, umbrella etc. portray the rich culture of the people. Finally, traditional festivals portray the cultural heritage of Ghanaians through the moral values, etiquettes, etc. In our traditional festivals, the elders and the people pay homage to the chief and his elders and this means that no matter the age of the chief people accord him the respect he deserves. The youth learn some moral and social values such as respect for authority and elders,",

2. Tolerant: A good leader must have a flexible mind and able to change to meet new situations. He must therefore, not be an autocratic leader. The must listen to his followers. A leader must be able to instill good human relations and this could be achieved by his being tolerant to others. He must be ready to accept or allow certain types of behaviour from others irrespective of whether he likes it o not.\n\n\
3. Foresight/Organizational Goals/Objectives: A good leader must attempt to make the organizational goals or objectives complementary to the group’s or follower’s objectives and direct the group or follower’s efforts towards those objectives. He must also be able to see into the future and plan a course of action with open mind.\n\n\
4. Ability to perceive the needs of the group and solve problems: A good leader must have the ability to perceive the needs of the group and organize the groups or followers efforts towards the satisfaction of those needs. The leader should be able to recognize societal problems and bring solutions to the problems, which will result in development. Ile must analyse the situation, develop plans of action and reach logical conclusions to solving the problems.\n\n\
5. Motivation: A good leader must employ appropriate techniques to motivate members of the group so that they work towards the achievement of the objectives of the group. A leader must motivate his followers through such techniques as praise, rewards, a pat on the back, promotions etc. which can encourage them to work hard towards the attainment of the goals of the group.\n\n\
6. Involvement in decision-making: A good leader must know when to delegate his orders or plans to his followers. He must also know when to involve the group in decision-making. This means that the leader must constantly involve the followers in the decision-making process. A sense of good will prevail if a leader allows his followers to take part in the decisions that affect them. This will make the followers feel that they belong to the group.\n\n\
7. Effective Communication: A good leader must keep the channels of communication in the organisation or group open for a free flow of information. This means that there must be effective conimunication between leaders and the followers. Both the leader and the follower must share information, so information must flow from the top to the bottom. This will enable the followers to know what is expected of them and be able to perform them well.\n\n\
8. Good health: A good leader must be of good health and physically fit .He must be hard-working so that his followers will show no laziness in the work entrusted to them. A leader must always appear neat and active."

question: "8. Discuss four ways of protecting the constitution of Ghana.",
definition: "The following are some of the ways of protecting the constitution of Ghana:",
options: "\
1. There must be public education on the constitution to explain its importance and what it contains.      This will help people to protect the constitution. The national and private papers, television, the various radio stations etc should be encouraged to discuss the constitution as part of their programmes. There should be public lectures, talks, drama etc. to show why the constitution should be protected.\n\n\
2. There should be good governance. This means that those ruling the nation should apply the principles of rule of law. In this situation, the government must tolerate freedom of expression and the mass media must be allowed to operate without censorship, intimidation or coercion.\n\n\
3. The existence of an independent, bold, impartial and incorruptible judiciary in a state helps to protect the rights and liberties of the citizen by ensuring fair adjudication of cases. An :independent judiciary ensures that the executive should not interfere with the work of the judiciary. The Judiciary Council should be given the freedom to appoint judges based on merit. The existence of provisions like judicial Review, which enables the judiciary to examine all laws passed by the legislature and actions taken by the Executive and declare some as null and void helps to safeguard citizens’ rights and liberties against abuses.\n\n\
4. Guarantee of fundamental human rights. The government should ensure that the constitution safeguards the fundamental human rights of citizens in the state. These fundamental human rights like the rights of life, worship, association etc are normally entrenched in the constitution so that a government in power cannot easily change these rights to suit its whims and caprices. The constitution also ensures that citizens whose rights are being trampled on seek redress at the courts. For instance a person who is detained without any charge and trial can file a writ of Habeas Corpus at the High Court.\n\n\
5. Press freedom is necessary to ensure the protection of the constitution. There must be a vibrant press to serve as a watchdog over the rights and liberties of the individuals and to expose any abuses,\n\n\
6. Educating the military-The military and other security agencies must be educated on their traditional role of protecting the country and the constitution and not to take arms to overthrow a constitutionally elected government from office on any flimsy reasons.\n\n\
7. There must be free and fair election supervised by an independent Electoral Commission. The Electoral Commission should be non-partisan so that people will respect the conduct of elections and its outcome.”\n\n\
8. The people must be involved in the decision making process. People must be informed on government policies and encouraged to express their views on such policies. There can be public for a where the press and the general public can met at regional, district or rural levels to discuss national policies or issues.\n\n\
9. Citizens should know their rights and obligations. The individual must know that rights are anything that one may do, have or claim by law. When people know the limit of their rights, they will know that the enjoyment of their rights should not be done at the expense of other people’s rights. People should know that rights go with obligations. It is unfortunate that in Ghana, there are people who claim too much of their rights but forget to perform their obligations. Obligations refer to what one is expected to perform as a duty. One must exercise his obligations to enable him demand his rights. In the exercising of obligations at the local and national levels, the national interest should be regarded supreme.\n\n\
10. To protect the constitution of Ghana there must be tolerance to diverse or opposing views. The government in power must tolerate the ideas and suggestions of its opponents. If a government controls the views of the people especially the opposition then that government is creating tension in the country. Since the constitution guarantees freedom of speech, the government should encourage people to share their views on national issues. This will reduce tension in the country and bring about harmony."

question: "9. Explain four factors that are responsible for deforestation in Ghana and suggest solutions to such environmental degradation.",
definition: "Deforestation is the destruction of forest without adequate measures to replenish them. The factors that are responsible for deforestation in Ghana include the following:",
options: "\
1. Indiscriminate burning of bush: Bush fires may result from careless handling of fire especially by palm wine tapers and hunters in the bush. Cattle rearers also set fire to the bush to promote growth of new shoots of grass to serve as fodder for their cattle. Bush fires may also result from our farming practices where we set fire to the bush after clearing the area for farming. These fires may get out of hand especially where proper fire belts are not constructed. These bush fires can lead to the destruction of forests and promote the growth of grass.\n\n\
2. Bad agricultural practices: Poor farming methods especially shifting cultivation which is practised in the forest zones is one major cause of deforestation. Shifting cultivation is a farming method whereby the forests are cleared for farming purposes for a few years. The farmer leaves the land for another piece of land without coming back to it again. The land is allowed to rest. This period of resting is called the fallow period. These farming practices allow farmers to clear forests indiscriminately, thereby removing the trees that hold the soil together which serve as protection to the undergrowth or other plant species.\n\n\
3. Clearing forest for industrialization and human settlement: The need to develop and expand large cities has led to the clearing of large tracts of forests for constructing industries, houses, etc. Land utilization for human settlement also leads to forest land being used for estate development. As a result forests are cleared for roads, rails, communication network etc\n\n\
4. Intensive lumbering: The constant felling of trees as timber for export to earn foreign exchange to support the socio-economic development of a country also contributes to deforestation. Domestically, timber may be cut to provide raw material for the saw mills and the furniture firms. The depletion of the forest resources has led to the Government banning chain-saw operators from cutting trees for domestic use.\n\n\
5. Intensification in cash crop production: Cash Crop production leads to the cutting down of trees and clearance of forest areas of agriculture. The production of crops like cocoa, cashew nuts, kola nuts, oil palm, citrus fruits, etc on a large scale for both the local market and foreign market to car foreign exchange has affected land for food crop production. In Twifo Praso and its environment, Twifo Oil Palm Plantation (TOPP) has acquired large tracts of land for oil palm plantation.\n\n\
6. Demand for fuel wood: Charcoal and firewood are the major source of fuel for cooking in many rural and urban towns. The intensive use of charcoal and firewood in the rural and urban centres had led to the cutting down of trees for firewood and charcoal thereby depleting the forest of potential trees for timber. Another effect is the extinction of woodlands to meet energy demands of households and cottage industries.\n\n\
7. Illiteracy/Lack of education: People are ignorant about the need to preserve the forest of in country. People do not know that depleting the country’s forest can lead to lack of rain and also affect our water bodies. It can also lead to desertification and reduction in food production and animal species.\n\n\
8. Lack of Inadequate enforcement of laws and regulations on deforestation: The attitude of farmers to modern methods of farming is not encouraging as many of them in the rural areas continue to use outmoded methods of farming. Forest rangers condone with chain saw operators to cut down trees thereby assisting in the depletion of the forest. The government does not have effective task force to check the indiscriminate cutting of trees. The absence of effective task force to assist forest rangers to track down chain saw operators contribute to depletion of the forests.\n\n\
9. Failure to replenish the forest by afforestation: Unfortunately forest resources are not replaced at the same rate at which they are depleted. In many farming areas farmers do not replace the trees they fell. Chain saw operators also indiscriminately destroy the forest of its resources but do not replenish the trees cut. \n\nThe suggested solutions to such environmental degradation include the following:\n\n\
1. Afforestation-tree planting: The government should provide the Forestry Department with the necessary facilities to raise seedlings in a nursery and transplant the young ones. Individual and organisations can also be encouraged to nurse trees and nurture them. District Assemblies may award prizes for effective tree planting on Environment Day.\n\n\
2. Education on the dangers of bush fires: The mass media the radio and television and the national papers should educate the public on dangers of bush fires. Films on bush fires and their effects on the environment should be shown to the public to see the need to stop bush fires during the dry season. Education should also be given through schools and youth organisations, chiefs and council of elders, by the use of posters, stickers and the mass media. The government should enforce laws and regulations on deforestation. The government should therefore enforce PNDC Law 46 and 229 on bush fires so that people who set fire to bushes would be brought before the laws of the country,\n\n\
3. Adopting sustainable farming methods: Farmers must adopt alley cropping to prevent deforestation rather than shifting cultivation. Forests around the rivers and streams should not be cleared. Wood lot farming is the type of farming in which definite trees are grown for definite purposes; fast-growing trees are often grown to achieve this e.g. Leucaena, Gliricidia, Teak, etc. These trees can be used for domestic purposes (e.g. poles or stakes in crop cultivation, for timber, house construction) and protection of the environment.\n\n\
4. Prevention of bush fires: Farmers must be taught the need to create fire belts between farms to check the spread of bush fires. Another measure is to burn cleared vegetation during the early part of the dry season. During this period the surrounding vegetation contains some amount of water, which prevents it from burning easily. The Ghana Fire Service must be adequately equipped with modern firefighting equipment to put out bush fires promptly.\n\n\
5. Legislation: The government should enact laws to regulate the activities of chain saw operation And also punish those who cause bush fires. People caught cutting trees should be prosecuted and in addition made to plant trees to cover the area destroyed.\n\n\
6. Institutions to Enforce the protection of the Forest: The government needs to maintain the forest reserves in the country and also establish new ones. The Wild Life department and the forestry department should be equipped with facilities such as vehicles, guns etc that will assist them in protecting the forest from chain saw operation."

question: "10. Discuss the measures that could be adopted by the government to ensure adequate food supply in the country.",
definition: "The measures that could be adopted by the government to ensure adequate food supply in the country include the following:",
options: "\
1. Improvement in the land tenure system: As population rises and the pressure on land grows, more effective system of land ownership must be worked out by the government so that farmers can acquire larger areas of land for cultivation. At least, such a new arrangement must ensure that each farmer has a land that belongs to him and it is this awareness that will encourage him to improve it. It also means that farmers’ land can be offered lo the commercial banks and agricultural credit institutions as securities for loans. Agricultural co-operatives will encourage farmers to own and cultivate land collectively. Chiefs and traditional rulers should be encouraged to release land for large- scale food production. Such an arrangement would allow large holdings, encourage mechanization, and enhance productivity.\n\n\
2. Improved Techniques and implements: The government can encourage the universities, polytechnics and firms which manufacture agricultural machinery to improve agricultural technology through research and development. The government should encourage farmers to use better or modern agricultural machinery like ploughs, tractors, planters and harvesters for large scale food crop production. Local agricultural implements like the cutlasses and hoes should be improved through research and development. Improved technology increases productivity and reduces cost of production. New research should be undertaken for the multiplication of improved varieties of livestock such as cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, fowls and crops such as rice, millet, maize etc.\n\n\
3. Provision of more irrigation facilities: Irrigation farming should be encouraged to avoid over reliance on the weather. The government can solve the problem of inadequate water for agricultural activities by ensuring that irrigation of dry lands is necessary to boost food crop production throughout the year. Field water can be conserved in simple dams and distributed along irrigation floods where necessary. Irrigation schemes such as those at Weija, Okyereko, Dawenya and Afienya are not only useful for the cultivation of food crop but also serve as sources of fishing. The Ghana – German Agricultural Extension Project (GGAEP) assisted the Northern Region to enable it raise its objective of food sufficiency by providing water by way of dams and dug-outs to increase the farmers’ agricultural productivity.\n\n\
4. Increased availability of storage facilities: The government should encourage farmers to purchase or build good storage facilities for their farm produce. This would improve the income of the farmer because of the value added. It would also create a larger market and better prices for farmer’s produce. Storage facilities like bin and shelf dryers for grain, cassava, pepper and plywood silos should be provided for farm products to minimize post-harvest losses. More silos should be cited in many rural farming communities to enable the small scale farmers take advantage of the scientific methods of drying grains offered by the silos. Extension officers in the Eastern Region have helped a number of small scale farmers in the region to build 400 cribs for on-farm storage of maize. Under the government’s grain storage programme silos have been built at Nkoransah, Techiman and Atebubu in the Brong Ahafo and Kumasi in the Ashanti Regions. Farmers are urged to utilize the silos by storing their maize, beans, groundnuts and other grains and legumes. The Chokor- Smoker is an improyed fish smoking kiln for fish processing. Cold rooms, deep freezers, refrigerators etc should be developed to store fish and meat.\n\n\
5. Guaranteed minimum prices for agricultural produce: Management of supply of food crops such as yams, plantain, cassava, cocoyam, potatoes tomatoes, beans, pepper etc. is necessary to ensure that more food crops are released unto the market in periods of high demand or low yield and vice versa. This will ensure guaranteed market price for agricultural produce. There should be marketing boards to ensure guaranteed minimum prices for major agricultural food crops so that farmers would be assured of better incomes from the sale of their food crops.\n\n\
6. Improvement in transportation network: The government should ensure that there is efficient transport network. More feeder roads should be provided for the farming areas. The conditions of existing feeder roads should also be improved, especially those leading to major agricultural areas to induce farmers to step up production. This will enable the farmers to send their food crops quickly to the urban centers for sale, which will reduce the wide price differential between areas and seasons and thereby encourage farmers to produce more. The maintenance of rural roads should be among the top priority of activities of the District Assemblies in the short to medium term. The government should encourage the District Assemblies to regularly maintain feeder roads linking the rural areas to the marketing centres. The development of feeder roads should include farm to village or market roads, which are equally very important.\n\n\
7. Increased extension services: The introduction of new methods of farming demands he employment of more agricultural extension workers who will travel to the farming areas and educate the farmers why these changes are necessary. Extension officers should’ encourage farmers to make changes, such as introducing a system of crop rotation, helping farmers to adopt improved seed varieties and also spreading the work of research institutes. The ratio of extension officer to farmers needs to be increased from the present ratio of 1:2000 to about 1:50. Extension officers should assist farmers to adopt researches carried out by the Ministry of Food and Agriculture and assist farmers to understand the simple application of fertilizers and the use of agro-chemicals. The Extension Development of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture should engage more extension officers who would bring their expertise to bear on food crop production, by providing them with the required information and technical know - how.\n\n\
8. Increased availability of credit facilities: The government should encourage financial institutions to provide adequate and flexible credit facilities at lower interest rates to food crop farmers at appropriate times to enable them to expand their farms for increased output. The loans can be provided directly by the co-operative credit societies, rural banks, commercial banks and agricultural development bank. Banks should be encouraged to relax their collateral security requirements in giving loans to people who wish to use them for agricultural development. Effective use of such loans will result in increased farm output and the introduction of modern methods of farming and improved management practices by the farmer. Inputs such as fertilizers, farms implements, weedicides, pesticides etc. should be given to farmers in lieu of the money granted them as loans.\n\n\
9. Increased availability of agricultural inputs such as cutlasses, fertilizers and pesticides etc.: The Government should encourage food crop farming by selling cutlasses, fertilizers, pesticides, insecticides and other inputs at subsidised prices to farmers. The subsidized inputs included fertilizers, improved seeds, production credit as well as insecticides, spraying machines and other simple tools used in food crop cultivation. In the Ghanaian economy where traditional technologies are still extensively used and the adoption of improved technology is very low providing subsidy will encourage the predominantly small-scale and financially poor farmers to adopt and use improved technologies to increase their output. The government should also encourage farmers to adopt better pest control methods and apply insecticides on affected plants regularly. The problem of animal pests and diseases can be solved by treating animals with insecticides to destroy the pests and by inoculating animals to cure them when they are sick. Testseflies can be destroyed by spraying. Crops like garden eggs and tomatoes, which are attacked by grasshoppers and nematode can be sprayed by pesticides to destroy the pests. This will lead to increase in both animal and vegetable production at lower prices"
