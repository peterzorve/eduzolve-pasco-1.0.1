question: "1b. Highlight four benefits of chastity to the adolescent.",
options: "\
1. Helps to avoid social stigma. An adolescent female who is able to keep herself from pre-marital sex helps her to avoid teenage pregnancy. At the same time, she avoids abortion and its attendant health risks like bleeding to death. So the adolescent who is chaste avoids the social stigma associated with being pregnant before marriage and being called ‘born one” A chaste adolescent avoids becoming an outcast and the abuse and rejection from her parents because she is pregnant with no man taking paternity of the child.\n\n\
2. Leads to responsible parenting: An adolescent female who is chaste is able to take proper care of her children and ensures their good bringing. As a result, such a woman can ensure that her children become useful citizens to the society.\n\n\
3. Promotes acquisition of better job opportunities: An adolescent who leads a chaste life is a focused person. He does not lead promiscuous life or follows friends who are aimless. His or her attention is on his or her education so that at the end he/she can get a better employment. The adolescent knows that by leading chaste life he/she is free from unwanted pregnancy and can avoid early pregnancy and childbearing with its attendant problems which can retard her ability to acquire a better job. This will enable her to learn a trade like sewing, bead making, hairdressing or open her own communication centre. A pregnant adolescent will have her dreams of learning a"

question: "3b. Explain four ways by which children cause their parents to be irresponsible.",
definition: "The following are some of the ways by which children cause their parents to be irresponsible:",
options: "\
1. Gross misconduct of children: The behaviour of most teenagers are such that they can make or cause their parents to behave in ways that may look irresponsible. For example, when a child smokes or drinks or leads promiscuous life this will make parents to be angry and behave in a away that may not be pleasant to the child.\n\n\
2. Ingratitude and resentfulness: Ingratitude and resentfulness on the part of children could be very hurtful and may lead parents to behave in ways that may seem irresponsible. When children are not grateful to their parents for providing their needs and do not reciprocate by performing their duties in the house this will make parents to show little interest in them.\n\n\
3. Flouting parental authority: Children may deliberately disobey, flout parental authority, join their peers in activities which parents fear could be harmful to their children, and may tend to make parents behave irresponsibly towards their children. 4. Peer influence: Children may join their peers in activities like smoking, drinking, drug abuse etc. which parents fear could be harmful to their children. This may tend to make parents abuse and disown such children.\n\n\
5. Displaying laziness/poor performance in school: Parents love their children and would do. anything possible to ensure that they do well in school. When the child frequently submits poor academic report this discourages parents from paying their school fees. Children who are lazy at school may not do their homework or assignments given them. Such children tend to copy other friends’ homework and present them as their own. When a child’s continuous assessment from school shows poor performance this will make the parents to become annoyed because they will feel worried about the huge school fees they pay as waste and may decide to stop. The parents may now feel that the investment they are making in their children is unnecessary and may therefore stop paying their school fees. The end result is that the child will have to drop out of school and become a vagabond.\n\n\
6. Engaging in truancy and absenteeism from school: Children who join bad friends who are truants are likely to copy their way of life. Truant children normally fail to attend classes and their academic record reflects a very poor performance at school. Truant children normally cut classes to be able to join their friends so that they can indulge in stealing, drinking, smoking and taking drugs. Parents become irresponsible when they find their children indulging in this way of life if they fail to listen to their advice and warnings.\n\n\
7. Refusal to perform assigned duties: Every parent would want to see his/her children perform house chores. This involves sweeping, running of errands, washing dishes, cooking etc. Failure to perform these chores attracts the anger and warnings of their parents. If the child continues to persist in this bad behavior his/her parents may feel reluctant to buy the child new clothes or even pay his or her school fees and also cut his/her pocket money. Stubborn children may persist in this behavior and this will cause their parents to be irresponsible by not supplying the child with his/her basic needs."

question: "6a. Identify four causes in conflict in Ghana.",
options: "\
1. Land Disputes/Litigation: Land disputes are a major source of conflict in our nation. For example, the conflicts between Alavanyo and Nkonya centred on land ownership, and so is the conflict between Tsito and Peki in the Volta Region. There had been at least 13 inter-ethnic and intra-ethnic conflicts in the North between 1980 and 1994.\n\n\
2. Chieftaincy disputes/Power struggle: Chieftaincy disputes are conflicts revolve around issues of inheritance and succession, which in turn are due to the absence of a uniform and legally enforceable set of governing rules. For example, the feud over the succession dispute arising from the death of Ya Na Abdulai Andani II. Disagreements between the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP) and the opposition National Democratic Congress(NDC) over certain policies (e.g. ROPAL) can cause conflict in the society.\n\n\
3. Intolerance: There have been conflicts between churches and the Ga Traditional Council over the ban on drumming during certain period of the year-i.e. conflicts over right to worship versus the right to the observance of traditional customary practices; conflicts erupting between different Islamic sects, etc. Often religious conflicts arise out of doctrinal differences.\n\n\
5. Unfair distribution of resources: At times, if a section of the society feels that it is not being treated fairly in the distribution of the national cake, appointments to prominent positions in government this situation may lead to conflict\n\n\
6. Injustice: Conflict may arise if a person feels cheated and will therefore retaliate. In other cases, people’s assets were unfairly confiscated; people were arbitrarily dismissed from the public service; and some were arbitrarily executed. These are human rights violations and can create resentments and conflicts. In other words, disregard for the rule of law lies at the root of some of the conflicts that plague our society\n\n\
7. Greed/Dishonesty: If some citizens decide to have more of the resources e.g farmland, inheritance etc. of community, this can generate into conflict. When some family members feel they are cheated in the sharing of family property the aggrieved party may take arms to protect their property.\n\n\
8. Discrimination: When a section of the community feels the are discriminated because they a minority group, then such people may harbour some ill- feeling which can develop into resentment against the chief or family head.\n\n\
9. Stereotyping or misconception: This results from tagging people as thieves, murderers, cheats, misers etc. For example, Fantes have been tagged as comedians, Ewes as inward looking people etc. Such stereotyping can cause rage in these people and cause conflict."

{
id: "question6b",
question: "6b. Describe four effects of conflicts.",
definition: "The following are some of the effects of conflicts:",
options: "\
1. Displacement of people: Conflicts lead to displacement of people. Civil wars compel people to flee towns, villages or countries to seek refuge in other places. Conflicts displace people to become refugees in other countries. The conflicts in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Cote D’viore have displaced large number of people as refuges in neighbouring countries including Ghana and Nigeria. As a result of civil wars many people lose their livelihood and cannot carry on with their normal economic activities because of the insecurity that goes with civil wars as a result displaced people move to safer areas or countries and become refugees in other countries.\n\n\
2. Destruction of life and property: When conflicts arise, the personal properties of people ii. like furniture, building, fridges, television sets, sewing machines are destroyed and burnt. People who are caught in the conflict especially old people, women and children are killed.\n\n\
3. Slow pace of development / stifles development of the state: When there is conflict it takes a long period of time for the country to put things in order. This is due to the fact that, most of the resources of the country like roads, industries water, electricity etc. are destroyed. It becomes therefore difficult for the country to construct new or reconstruct broken down bridges, repair rail way lines, and roads and import new transformers from outside for the electricity company and also provide clean water for the people.\n\n\
4. Destruction of infrastructure: Conflicts lead to the destruction of facilities like roads,\n\n\
4. railways, bridges, dams, hospitals, schools, water, farms, electricity, industries etc. since during civil war or conflicts people target these infrastructures and destroy them so that people cannot enjoy them. The destruction of these infrastructures’ retards development and cause discontent in the country.\n\n\
5. It results in low productivity: Conflicts destroy the economic base of the country since industries, farms, roads, bridges, electricity etc are usually target for destruction. The result is that due to insecurity which farmers face they cannot go to their farms. Industries cannot get regular supply of raw materials from the rural areas. Output from farms and industries will fall since movement of goods and services cannot take place if the bridges and roads of the country are destroyed.\n\n\
6. Conflicts bring about poverty and famine: The destruction of farm lands and harvested crops leads to poverty. People whose farms and harvested crops are burnt and destroyed become poor since they are their means of livelihood. Since farm lands and harvested crops have been destroyed shortage of food may arise and this will result in famine.\n\n\
7. Outbreak of diseases: Conflicts brings about outbreak of diseases like cholera, malaria, malnutrition etc. Due to the unavailability of good food, good drinking water and the unsightly spectacle of dead human beings and animals, women and children may be exposed to various diseases like cholera which can claim the lives of many.\n\n\
8. It leads to the destruction of the environment: The vegetation of the country may be destroyed by landmines and may be littered with abandoned ammunitions and heavy military equipments. Refuse may pile up without anyone attending to it. Rivers and streams may be littered with dead bodies and animals which will make them unwholesome to drink. When the pollution of the environment is not cleaned this will cause epidemic.\n\n\
9. It leads to abuse of human rights: Conflicts can bring about curfews, indiscriminate arrest and imprisonment.\n\n\
10. Hatred: Conflict breeds hatred among members of warring factions. This can bring about enmity or rancour between feuding factions and lead to an unending conflict in an area.\n\n\
11. Diversion of resources: Conflicts lead to diversion of resources meant for agriculture for the purchase of guns and military equipment. This means that agricultural production will suffer. The government will also have to divert resources (i.e. foreign currency) meant for the importation of raw materials for manufacturing industries or provide drugs for hospitals to transport emergency policemen and soldiers to the area of conflict. The burden of feeding lodging fueling their cars etc. will all become an additional cost the government.\n\n\
12. Conflict brings about insecurity: Farmers may fear to go to farm to either work or bring home food. The problem of insecurity may grip the country and scare foreign investors from investing in war torn- country."

question: "8b. Highlight four factors to be considered in community development decision making process.",
definition: "The following are some of the factors to be considered in: community development decision making process.",
options: "\
1. Identification of needs: It is very necessary that in making decisions for the community, community leaders meet to identify their needs and know how to solve such needs. If, for example, a community needs certain projects it is very necessary that community leaders meet to make decisions by way of identifying the problems of the community and upon the basis of these problems, make a decision that will be in the interest of the community. It is the duty of each of us to ensure that individual Ghanaians become aware of the problems of the community and to use all available resources to help solve the identified problems.\n\n\
2. Sensitization of the people: When a community wants to undertake a development project e.g. a school, community leaders can to sensitize the people on the need to undertake such project. If people are made aware of the need to develop the community and are also involved in the making decisions for the community, then the people of the community will be prepared to use their time, energy and their resources for the community. Prioritization of needs: After the needs of the community have been identified, the community leaders who make decisions for the community must prioritize the needs of the community in order of importance. When the needs (eg. school, toilet, market, clinic, water, and electricity) of the community have arranged in order of priority, then the most pressing or important need is selected or chosen and implemented.\n\n\
4. Study of the alternative solutions: Decision making bodies in the community must study the alternative solutions to solving the problems of the community. Since there are many ways in solving community problems, community leaders, who are the decision making bodies, should look out for all the possible ways of finding alternative solutions to the needs of the community.\n\n\
5. Mobilizing community support: The community decision making body should solicit the support of the people when making decisions. In this way, the people for whom they make decisions must agree to their proposals before they decide on any matter.\n\n\
6. Mobilizing funds and resources: In making decisions on raising funds and resources for community development, community leaders must make the people aware that availability of funds and resources are necessary to undertake any community development project. The continued development of our communities depends on the contributions we make as individuals. Every individual should see the need to pay tax, vote at elections, work hard and volunteer information."

id: "question9a",
question: "9a. Explain the term maintenance culture.",
definition: "Maintenance culture is the habit of servicing and repairing tools, machines, infrastructure and other facilities regularly to ensure their long stay.",
options: "\
1. Good education and professional or vocational training: Schools often provide basic education and lead to increased literacy. Individuals who acquire high education in medicine, engineering, pharmacy, and teaching enable them to practice their profession with competence and are able to earn better incomes and enjoy a better standard of living. For example an literate farmer who goes through non-formal education can read and follow instruction in the application of say, fertilizer and adopt modern methods of farming will be able to increase his level of output as against an illiterate farmer who cannot read. Training facilities provided by Technical schools, farm Institutes, Commercial and Vocational schools help to improve the skills of workers. A clerk who can use a computer can perform better than an ordinary typist. If individuals acquire vocational training they can open their own carpentry shop, hair dressing salon, barbering shop, fitting shop etc to earn a living and ensure a better sustainability in their lives.\n\n\
2. Continuous improvement of one’s skills: Individuals can improve on their skills through further education either locally or oversees. Further studies will thus expose workers to new ideas, skills, experience and in-depth knowledge of their various fields of work, broaden their scope and help increase productivity. Individuals could also avail themselves of facilities provided to train workers on the job. This could take the form of refresher courses to help keep the individual abreast with new development and methods of carrying out certain work schedules. Such refresher courses could be seminars, conferences, workshops, lectures and symposia. This will help to broaden but also deepen individuals outlook and understanding of their job specifications\n\n\
3. Having set goals and working toward their attainment; Individuals must set goals which are achievable. This means that the individual must have a definite plan to be considered. If, for example, an individual decides to set up a business he must decide what type of product to produce. To achieve this aim or goal he has to employ all resources to work toward its achievement. However, if the planning is poor the entrepreneur cannot achieve his aim\n\n\
4. Maintaining future financial plan e.g insurance policies, savings etc.: People should develop the attitude of savings by putting some money aside each month. Savings can be done through Banks, Post Office Savings Account, and Credit unions. One can save at the bank for some period of time and withdraw such money to start a business which will earn him/her an income. Self-generated funds or money accumulated over the years can be used in future to solve any financial problem so that one does not resort to borrowing from the banks or money lenders who will charge high interest rate. Individuals can plan for his future by saving for his retirement. On retirement one can enjoy a regular pension every month which one can use to buy ones needs till one die.\n\n\
5. One must lead a moderate lifestyle: To ensure sustainability in a person’s life one must budget or make a scale of preference so that one will spend within one’s budget. Spending lavishly causes poverty since you overspend. If you make a budget you spend your money wisely and do not buy unnecessary things which are a waste of money. If you plan to buy a colour TV set you first consider you monthly income and decide to buy the one you can conveniently pay outright or on a monthly instalment’s basis. If you buy a flat screen TV set when you know you cannot afford it then you put yourself in trouble. At the same time, one must also manage one’s resources like electricity, water, food etc. wisely. One must manage the usage of electricity and water discreetly by making sure that lights, fans are off when not needed so that light and water bills will not increase. An individual must therefore live within her means.\n\n\
6. One must shun laziness so as to work hard for development. To ensure sustainability in person’s life that person must shun laziness to ensure that he contributes to the increase in output at his work place. He must go to work on time and leave the work place at the correct time. Workers should not absent themselves from work or use working hours to work lotto or do their personal business. If the Ghanaian worker changes his/her attitude to work by being punctual at work, using working hours wisely and reducing waste labour productivity will increase. When workers exhibit hard work, loyalty, honesty, productivity will increase\n\n\
7. An individual must develop positive attitude to solving problems: A individual can ensure sustainability in his life by ensuring that his problems are solved in a proper manner. If a person cannot solve his problems pragmatically the problem will persist. A person must therefore go to the roots of his/her problems and ensure that the problems are tackled from that end. If a person has financial problems the person must look to the root of the problem and change his/her style of spending by adopting moderate lifestyle that is, living within his means."

question: "10. Outline five ways by which information communication technology can promote socio- economic development in Ghana.",
options: "\
1. Information communication technology (ICT) enhances efficiency at workplace by speeding up work. Let us imagine a secretary using a manual type-writer. Just consider the number of mistakes that she will commit in typing a document. Any time she makes the mistake she has to throw the paper away and start all over again. This comes at a cost and also time is wasted, not to talk about the frustration if the type-writer is very old. With modern computers corrections can be easily made and copies printed in no time. Also think of our system of storing information. How difficult it is sometimes to get or find files you need valuable information from. This delays work and doesn’t call for efficiency. However, with information technology we can store our information and retrieve it easily. In fact information is just a mouse click away. Also we can keep our information for so many years without fear of rodents destroying them.\n\n\
2. Promotion of knowledge and skills for work: ICT is a medium through which knowledge could be acquired with the help of the internet, also known as the information superhighway. The talk around town is that we are now in a knowledge-based economy. Knowledge they say is power. Information technology places at our feet a huge knowledge bank. The very latest research and the very current edition of books are on the internet for our taking. Almost every imaginable information in every possible field of knowledge is covered and can be found on the internet. Therefore it serves as a great source of education.\n\n\
3. Useful in all areas of infrastructural development: ICT has made transportation faster and more efficient. We have lorries, trains, ships, aeroplanes, motor bikes for fast movement of people, goods and services. Distances between towns, villages and cities have reduced greatly since people can now travel to any place they want to transact whatever business they have in view. Roads, bridges, dams can now be constructed with sophisticated machine which make their construction faster. Fast moving trains are now available to move passengers to long distances at a very short time.\n\n\
4. Creation of employment. This is very true of those who manufacture the components of the equipment that helps to disseminate information technology. ICT gives employment to those who manufacture the net working equipment, the computers, the printers, the cables etc. It also gives employment to those who assemble those components into finished products and those who sell computers. Experts are also employed to write the soft wares, which help drive the various components of information technology. Those who manage the huge net- work systems and data entry clerks who work in the offices and enter information into the computers are employed as a result of ICT. The repairers and internet café operators and owners and those who run computer schools have had jobs as a result of information technology.\n\n\
5. Bridging the gap between nations: ICT bridges the gap between nations in terms of information flow or exchange. Gone are the days that one will have to wait for so many months before one could receive letters. Gone are the days when one may have to travel over long distances to see a loved friend or relative. With modern communication equipment the world has become a global village through ICT, one can within a mater of seconds, send information across the world to africa through E-mail, a chat system, etc and get an instant reply. In fact one can even chat with a friend who is so many miles away as if the person is sitting next to him. Even with a video camera one can see whoever he or she is chatting with. In fact ICT has brought the world so close together such that now we are more or less like staying in a village and being citizens of one village. This calls for better understanding of each other’s way of life so that together we can protect this village of ours. IT therefore gives room for what is called collaborative projects; that is, projects that cut across international boundaries. Projects that are done with the help of telecommunication gadgets like the internet, computers; projects done by teachers and students in different countries enable us to better understand each other just as you want to understand your neighbour thus bringing the world closer and closer. Through IT we have become so close that we have each become our brother’s keeper. Mountains, oceans, and rivers do not matter anymore because your friend who perhaps is in Greenland is just a phone call or E-mail away.\n\n\
6. Promotion of health care delivery: ICT is used to link health-care providers and researchers, enabling them to share medical images, patients’ records and research. If there is one area where IT can be of great advantage especially to a country like Ghana, it is in the field of medicine. A specialist at Korle-bu Teaching Hospital through the internet can treat patients at different hospitals scattered all over Ghana if only they also have telecommunication gadgets fixed at their hospitals. A surgeon/specialist can view a patient or an operation going on in another hospital on a monitor in his hospital and can take part in this operation by giving verbal instructions as to what is to be done. This is because he can see what is going on on his screen. A doctor who is not sure of the symptoms presented by a patient can easily go on the internet and into a. chat room meant for doctors to confer with a fellow doctor elsewhere to find a better cure for this patient. A pharmacist who may not have the the medicine prescribed by a doctor in his/her pharmacy can just go across the internet and find out places where this medicine could be gotten and even make arrangement for it to be brought to him/her so that he/she can give it to his/her patient. As a result of ICT medical services are greatly enhanced. This is not to talk about the latest discoveries in the world of medicine. Such information could be easily shared among doctors and nurses.\n\n\
7. Promotion of delivery of education:- IT has given rise to what is called E-learning or electronic learning. It is becoming very possible now for people to take courses on the internet. What it means is that people can still work and get their degree. Time is saved and productivity still goes on and the professional development of workers is enhanced. One can also talk of virtual campuses where a lecturer in a university can lecture in so many universities at the same time. Students just have to gather in educational centres with Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) projectors or monitors and follow as the lecturer lecturers in whatever he/she is teaching. They can even also ask QUEs as if the lecturer is standing right in front of them. The internet which is a part of IT presents a huge library. In fact it is the worlds’ biggest library. Also we can find templates of lesson plans, which teachers have already made and it is so easy to follow these lesson plans and become better teachers.\n\n\
8. Promotion of the undertaking of research: New teaching techniques, which have been tried out and found to be successful, can all be found on the internet. Through IT we can easily collect and analyze data through research. Hitherto difficult areas, which seemed to defy easy understanding has now been conquered as a result of the use of IT. There is now a huge catologue of research, which has helped the development of scientific equipment. Through research, radio therapy, which involves the use of X-ray and other radiation devices can now be used to cure cancer and kill cancer cells.\n\n\
9. Promotion of commerce and banking: – IT has greatly aided the banking practices of many a country. Currently banks such as Barclays Ghana Ltd., Standard Chartered Ghana Ltd. and others provide ATM (Automatic Teller Machine) services, which dispenses monies even after work and on weekends as well as holidays. This makes banking so easy and less stressful to the customer who has to queue for long hours for his money. Time is saved and productivity still goes on. One can also talk of money transfers. Now it is possible to transfer money from one country to another and from one region to another and from one town to another. Customers’ time is saved and banking is made easy. There is no need to carry huge sums of money around. Customers can now use their mobile phones to check their balances. In the field of commerce we now have what is called E-commerce or electronic commerce. It is simply an on- line shopping which enables the customer to sit in the comfort of his/her room, shop for the latest goods and services all over the world.\n\n\
10. Promotion of better farming practices: Through ICT the latest innovations in the agricultural field are brought to our doorsteps. We get to know the kind of practices other farmers elsewhere are following to increase food production and to ensure food security for the nation. The internet also provides a huge market for our agricultural products. Thus collaborative projects could study how our farming practices have had an effect on the ecology of the world. By so doing we all assume a responsibility of protecting the ecology of our world.\n\n\
11. Promotion of collection of information, analysis and storage of data for present and future use: Our system of storing information is very poor since it is difficult sometimes to get or find files you need valuable information from. This delays work and doesn’t call for efficiency. However, with information technology we can store our information and retrieve it easily. In fact information is just a mouse click away. Also we can keep our information for so many years without fear of rodents destroying them. New teaching techniques, which have been tried out and found to be successful, can all be found on the internet. Through IT we can easily collect and analyze data through research. Hitherto difficult areas, which seemed to defy easy understanding has now been conquered as a result of the use of IT. There is now a huge catologue of research, which has helped the development of scientific equipment"
