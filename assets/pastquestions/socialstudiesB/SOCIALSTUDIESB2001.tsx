question: "1. Discuss the importance of the bride price in customary marriage",
definition: "The importance of the bride price in customary marriage may be seen in the following ways: 1. It shows",
options: "\
1. Formal parental or family approval to the union of the two individuals concerned. In customary marriage the bride price shows that the families of the bride and bridegroom accept the union of the two individuals and therefore give their blessings to the marriage. It therefore unifies the two families, since the bride price brings the bride’s and the bridegroom’s families together.\n\n\
2. It confers on the husband, his authority on the wife in all matters relating to the immediate family and relationship with kins and neighbours. The bridegroom now takes absolute control over the bride by providing her needs and also giving her protection and comfort.\n\n\
3. It is a token expression by the bridegroom’s family of their appreciation and gratitude to the virtuous way the bride was brought up and taken care of. It also serves as compensation for the temporary loss of their daughter since her services will no longer be rendered to the parents but to the bridegroom.\n\n\
4. It guarantees paternity of the bridegroom on the children. In customary marriage the bride price confers authority of the bridegroom on the children and that explains why the bridegroom names the children after himself and his family members. It is the responsibility of the bridegroom to take care of the children by sending them to school and making sure that they are decently brought up.\n\n\
5. It guarantees survival of the union and discourages divorce as dissolution of such union can only be approved by repayment of the bride price, which may sometimes be difficult to refund,\n\n\
6. It confers honour and prestige on the bride, the family and the community. In customary marriage, the bride price shows that the bride is now a married woman and she is accorded respect by the bridegroom’s family and the community and other suitors can not ask for her hand in marriage.\n\n\
6. It also demonstrates how valuable the bridegrooms’ family consider their prospective daughter in- law- to be. As a result the bride is respected by the bridegroom’s family and given the necessary assistance she needs all the time. She is therefore expected to put up a good behavior and live up to the expectation of the family."

question: "2. What advantages does one derive from belonging to an extended family in Ghana?",
options: "\
1. Mutual assistance: The extended family provides mutual assistance in times of need. Family members provide security for those in financial need, ill or in their old age. There is always a relative i.e. uncle, aunt, brother, sister or cousin etc at hand to provide assistance. The poor, orphan, widow/widower are all catered for by the well to do in the family.\n\n\
2. Social control mechanism: The extended family serves as a social control to check wayward members. The moral upbringing of the young ones becomes the responsibility of the extended family. The extended family ensures that family members have good character and also do their best to advise them not to indulge in vices like stealing, fighting etc which would affect the good name of the family. As a result, family members are taught values such as unity, sharing and hard work. The extend family therefore maintains law and order among the family members through discipline and harmonious living habits. Also, family members are scolded if they offend one another.\n\n\
3. Sense of togetherness: The extended family provides an environment in which the individual feels he belongs to a larger and more exclusive group. This means that it brings about togetherness among members of the extended family when they are bereaved, or there is marriage or there is naming ceremony. All members of the family come together to solve family problem. For example, during funerals or other social engagements, there is a collective responsibility to ensure success by members contributing money and other items needed for the ceremony or occasion.\n\n\
4. Provides family labour: Family members come together to work on the farm of a family member without any financial cost. The nnoboa system, which is very common in the rural areas, is a major source of labour for family members who are financially weak to hire labour to work on their farms.\n\n\
5. Socialisation: The extended family ensures the affective socialisation of children in the family. It socialises children of deceased members and others in need by teaching them the beliefs, values and social norms of the people. Through transmission of culture of the people the children become disciplined. Also, there is the joy of living together since the extended family members e.g., parents, siblings, uncles, aunts, cousins, nephews, grandparents etc. ensure harmonious co-existence.\n\n\
6. Confers prestige on its members: The extended family confers prestige on its members, particularly when one family is well to do or respectable one, when an individual belongs to a respected family, that is, a royal family he is easily identified and accorded respect. When a family member belongs to a Royal family, he is accorded respect and this makes him to exhibit good behaviour in the society."

question: "3. What factors that account for the low productivity in the public sector in Ghana?",
definition: "Low productivity in the public sector in Ghana may be due to the following factors:",
options: "\
1. Negative or poor attitude to work : Productivity is low in the public sector in Ghana than in the private sector because of poor attitude to work like absenteeism, lateness, loitering, laziness etc. Most workers in the public sector go to work late for example, if the time to start work is eight o’clock in the morning, and the worker arrives at the work place at ten o’clock in which case the output, which should have been achieved, would decline.\n\n\
2. Lack of commitment and apathy: There is low sense of duty on the part of public sector workers than with the private sector workers. Public sector workers have the perception that government work does not belong to anybody and can be approached anyhow. Such apathetic attitude to things that belong to the public sector leads to waste of government resources, pilfering and poor handling of government equipment with the attendant effect of low output per worker.\n\n\
3. Lack of incentives: There is lack of adequate motivation like generous allowances, bonuses, or awards for hard working, transport allowances, canteen facilities, free medical attention etc for the public sector workers than for the private sectors. Workers in the public do not give full attention to their work because of the poor conditions of work that pose as disincentive to hard work and increased productivity. Their counterparts in the private sector enjoy better working conditions that promote high productivity. Low wages or salaries also discourage workers in the public sector workers from putting in their best in the jobs assigned to them and this explains why output in the public is sector low. A worker who is poorly paid cannot meet his/her financial commitment and therefore cannot be expected to work hard and increase his/her output.\n\n\
4. Pilfering and embezzlement: Embezzlement and stealing of public funds are not strictly checked by the public sector as compared to the private sector, which has strict management control. In the public sector there is lack of government control of the operations of government owned enterprises. As a result workers and management take this opportunity to embezzle, steal and misuse public funds. Also there is the general belief that money belonging to the government belongs to everybody and so public officials lose their right sense of judgment concerning government funds.\n\n\
5. Bureaucracy: In the public sector unlike the private sector there is adherence to too many rules and regulations or excessive and complicated official routine. This makes simple jobs take a longer time than normal to complete. The result is that a lot of man-hours are lost or wasted through long delays, which decreases the amount of work completed within a specific time thereby resulting in low productivity in the government sector. Also because of the excessive use of formalities and strict adherence to rules and regulations there are delays in executing government policy and this can breed corruption among high officials.\n\n\
6. Frequent political interference: There is high political interference in the administration of the public sector than in the private sector. The government owns public corporations and as a result political office holders take undue advantage to interfere in the day-to-day administration of these state owned corporations. Political office holders therefore appoint their close relations and friends to positions in the state corporations where they may not have the necessary requisite qualifications to perform the duties assigned to them. The result is putting square pegs in round holes. This may result in over staffing, high operational costs and poor administrations.\n\n\
7. Inadequate/lack of facilities in the public sector: In the public sector most work places lack adequate ventilation, lighting, better sanitation, modern equipment etc. Public sector offices are only equipped with manual typewriters, which can perform only a few functions. These obsolete machines are expensive to service and difficult to operate and therefore require a large workforce to operate them. The poor state of machines in the public sector which often breakdown when output becomes great or too much reduces output. A lot of the machines are old and weak and have to be either serviced repeatedly or replaced. However the absence of funds and the high cost of spare parts or new equipment’s make it impossible for these items to be purchased by the government to increase output. The output of many state-owned institutions is very because of lack of raw materials. This situation does not often happen in the private sector, which has to ensure that machines and equipment are always in perfect condition to increase output.\n\n\
8. Lack of inadequate supervision: There is better supervision of workers in the private sector than in the public sector. Unlike the private sector where there are supervisors around who are always on the look out for signs of laziness, unnecessary loitering etc, workers in the public sector are virtually left on their own without any supervision. Supervision in the public sector is therefore not very strict and workers tend to loiter about, converse and work lotto thereby wasting man-hours, which could have been used to increase productivity."

question: "4. Why is it necessary for the individual to know himself or herself?",
definition: "It necessary for the individual to know himself or herself because of the following reasons:",
options: "\
1. An individual has to know himself or herself so that he/she can take the right decisions in life. The individual can make the right choices in life at the right time and place. If the individual is able to make good decisions or good choices in life it will make him/her self-reliant (i.e. rely on himself or herself and not on other people for his or her needs), trustworthy, dependable and independent in choosing the right profession, marriage partner etc.\n\n\
2. An individual has to know himself or herself so that he/she can relate to and cordially live with others. Interpersonal relationship is essential in the community since it helps the individual to relate well to others and move or mix and communicate amicably with people around him. This will help to promote brotherliness, understanding and peaceful co-existence.\n\n\
3. Another reason why it is necessary for an individual to know himself is for one to identify his/her positive qualities and be able to know what he/she has, can do to help himself and society. If the individual is able to identify the good or positive qualities or potentialities that he has, this will help him/her to develop them. An individual who has the potentiality of singing, drumming or dancing can be helped to develop these positive qualities in life to the best of his ability,\n\n\
4. An individual has to know himself or herself so that he/she can identify his/her weaknesses and shortcomings. Some of these may be arrogance, pride, laziness, self-praising, drunkenness, stealing etc. If an individual is arrogant he/she can be helped to correct or overcome it and thus become a good citizen in the community.\n\n\
5. It is necessary for an individual to know himself so that he can appreciate other people’s views and their perceptions. Knowledge of oneself will enable the individual to have a good assessment of others, appreciate, what other people can achieve, accept others opinion, impression or any comments made by others about him/her. This will help the individual to change his/her negative attitude and improve upon his positive qualities. For example an individual will feel guilty when people point out his offences or shortcomings to him but feel happy and not swollen-headed when praised for any good thing done.\n\n\
6. An individual has to know himself so that he can understand himself and accept himself. The individual will then be able to do his best with his /her resources and take things calmly and not be a worried person, frustrated or dejected with his weaknesses."

question: "5. Discuss the advantages which formal education has over informal education",
definition: "The advantages which formal education has over informal education include the following:",
options: "\
1. Scientific Approach: Formal education uses scientific teaching methods in its approach to teaching. This involves the use of systematic method of observing situations. This step-by-step approach of observing, classifying and experimenting issues is aimed at gaining an understanding of how things happen. Informal education, on the other hand, relies on trial and error method of teaching.\n\n\
2. Acquisition of knowledge: In formal education, the individual acquires knowledge, which enables him/her to go beyond her immediate environment. Formal education produces skilled personnel in various fields of endeavour. For example, doctors and nurses after their training can decide to work in any part of the country. Teachers also after their training are also posted to every part of the country to impart their knowledge to school children. The training that teachers, doctors or nurses acquire during their training enables them to live with other people. Informal education is restricted to the environment and does not expose people beyond their immediate environment.\n\n\
3. Proper documentation of events or situations: Formal education unlike informal education enables proper documentation of events and situations to take place. Through formal education the Ghanaian cultural heritage is preserved and the society is able to maintain her national identity. Through formal education the history of the country has been documented and is taught in schools and the Universities of the country.\n\n\
4. Mental liberation: Through formal education the Ghanaian mind is now partially liberated from superstitious beliefs, prejudice against females and ignorance, which were all hindrances to development. People attributed sickness, famine, strange disease etc to ancestors but through formal education people now know that sickness or sudden death may be due to poor sanitations or uncleanliness. People who kill twins in some parts of the country now know that twins are real human beings and should not be killed. In informal education people are still encouraged to consult the ancestors for solutions to their problems.\n\n\
5. Outmoded cultural practices: Through formal education most of the outmoded cultural practices have been eliminated from the society, saving human life and properly. For example, practices like human sacrifices, female circumcision, widowhood riles, trokosi system and so on, which hinder human progress and development are completely or partially eliminated. Informal education, on the other hand, teaches people to accept the cultural practices of their ancestors without question.\n\n\
6. Improved standard of living: With the introduction of formal education, the acquisition of skills and position has brought higher incomes to help raise and improve people’s standard of living. People now live in better houses, eat good food, enjoy better sanitation and have better communication and transport system which have made life worth living. Informal education is restricted to the environment and skills acquired cannot be used elsewhere to improve one’s standard of living.\n\n\
7. Awareness that handicapped people can be useful citizens: Formal education unlike informal education has created awareness that handicapped people can live to become useful citizens. For example, the blind, deaf and dumb etc can now attend schools and become useful citizens. There are blind teachers who teach craft in the primary schools. Another case is that of Endonym, born without arms, who has now grown to be useful person. Informal education frowns on handicapped education and integration into the society.\n\n\
8. Family and population control mechanism: Through formal education, there is a shift from the extended family to the nuclear family system which is smaller, manageable and easy to control. People are now planning and controlling their families through the National Family Planning Programme and the use of many contraceptive devices. In informal education there is more emphasis on extended family than the nuclear family system.\n\n\
9. Nationalistic feeling: Formal education unlike informal education has connected people from different tribes and ethnicity together. The tribal divide is gone and people from different ethnic groups or tribes see themselves as one people with one destiny. Things are now done at the national level. The nation first informal education is has connected people from different tribes and ethnicity together. The tribal divide is gone and people from different ethnic group or tribes see themselves as one people with one destiny. Things are now done at the national level the nation first. Informal education is inward looking and does not bring other tribes together.\n\n\
10. General development: Through formal education people acquire knowledge and skill so that the environment could be harnessed to tap the natural resources like gold, manganese, etc for the benefit of man. There is technological development or advancement through the invention of machines and equipment. People and firms can now communicate at any time and place with no hindrance.\n\n\
11. Literacy and numeracy: Through formal education people can now read and write. In Ghana the English Language is the major medium of instruction in the schools and is used for communication with other countries. It is also used at international meetings and conferences. Formal education unlike informal education enables traders and businessmen to record their accounts of their daily business activities and also allows debts and payments to be recorded. Dates of important events can also be recorded."

question: "6a. Explain why female genital mutilation or widowhood rites should be abolished in Ghana.",
definition: "Female genital mutilation is a genital operation normally performed on females before they reach adolescent age. It involves the cutting off of the clitoris, or labia minora (the inner lips) and often the labia majora (the outer lips) and sewing her vulva, leaving just a tiny opening for urine and for menstrual flow. Purpose: The aim of this operation is to make the female lose the urge to perform sexual act and to preserve her virginity till marriage . Others link the practice to some religious rites that do not exempt females because circumcision makes the female clean. Reasons why it is outmoded",
options: "\
1. Female genital mutilation is a health hazard. The use of unsterilized instruments during the process of removing the girl’s clitoris may lead to infection resulting in tetanus, infertility, AIDS etc. In some serious cases, the girl may bleed so excessively that she may die through loss of blood. Also the various herbs used to stop the bleeding and heal the wounds after the operation do not have their efficiency and efficacy proven and if the girl is unfortunate, the bleeding would be so intense that she can lose her life.\n\n\
2. Female genital mutilation should be abolished because there is loss of sexual sensitivity. It denies the girl sexual pleasure, enjoyment and satisfaction when she later marries. This is because when the most sensitive part of the female sexual organ called the clitoris is cut off it denies the woman the sexual enjoyment she can derive from sexual act/intercourse with h.er husband. The woman may get bored with the act of sex and this can easily lead to problems in the marriage.\n\n\
3. Another reason for abolishing female genital mutilation is that it results in difficulty in childbirth. The operation affects smooth delivery because it brings about complications when the woman is giving birth. After the wound has healed it leaves a scar, which closes the genitalia making it difficult for the woman to give birth smoothly. The difficulty of giving birth can sometimes result in the death of the woman\n\n\
4. Society frowns on female genital mutilation because of the many problems associated with it. Some of these problems include, menstrual pains, persistent pelvic pain, vulya abscess, and large cyst Some of these problems include menstrual pains, persistent pelvic pain, yulva abscess and large cysts requiring surgical removal. Societies, which practice female circumcision, are frowned at.\n\n\
5. Female genital mutilation is a painful process since the operation involves no use of anesthesia. The agonising pain that the girl goes through involves the cutting off the clitoris, or the labia minora (the inner lips) and the labia majoria (the outer lips) with crude instruments. The bleeding that comes after the operation may be so intense that the girl can lose her life.\n\n\
6. Female mutilation is a violation of the child’s rights. It is demeaning and insulting to the integrity of womanhood, Girls who undergo it do not do so willingly. Infact, they have no choice to say no. Girls who refuse to do it are ostracized from the community and called by insulting names. Infact, female genital mutilation has been condemned by the convention on the rights of the child. Finally, female genital mutilation cannot be justified on any biological or medical grounds, no matter the cultural justification"

question: "6b. What is widowhood rites?",
definition: "Widowhood rites are rites or practices that a woman or man undergoes following the death of a husband or wife respectively. These prevail in various forms among some ethnic groups in Ghana, Purpose: i. In order that ghost (spirit) of the dead spouse would not haunt the spouse. ii. To give strength to the living spouse to stand firm during the period of grief ii. To make the living spouse to realise the difficulties that lie ahead of the widow as her bread winner is gone. Reasons why it should be avoided the practice of widowhood rites is dehumanizing and humiliating. For example, after the death of a husband the widow’s hair is shaved or her hands are tied and pulled or she is made to walk bare- footed and her movement and speech are restricted. This practice infringes on the rights of the individual. Widowhood rites should be avoided because it is a health hazard. The spouse after the death of her husband may be denied food which may result in ulcer. Sometimes the spouse would be forced to swallow the saliva of her dead husband, which may result in coughs or tuberculosis etc. In some communities the widow may have pepper poured into her eyes which may create eye problems. Another reason why widowhood rites should be abolished is that it brings about mental stress and embarrassment on the widow. The widow goes through pains from the torture she receives from the relatives of the dead husband. Some widows are also subjected to obnoxious rites like sleeping with the dead spouse or being confined in a room for a period between 3-9 days. This situation puts fear in the widow concerned. Widowhood rites are also a way of maltreating spouses especially women by the relatives of the dead person. This kind of cultural practice is discriminatory because men are usually not treated the same way when their wives die. For example, the practice of putting pepper into the eyes of only widows and not widowers is discriminatory. Also, during the period when the widow is confined in the room for a period between 3-9 days the relatives of the dead husband may take this opportunity to do away with some properties which the dead husband might have acquired with her wife during the time that the husband was alive. Another reason why widowhood rites should be abolished is that spouses may lose their jobs as a result of spending a very long time at home as required by custom. A widow may stay at home for more than two to three months without either going to the farm or to attend to any business because she is assumed to be mourning her dead husband. If she violates this custom she is branded as the one who killed her husband and may be called a witch. These outmoded cultural practices impose economic hardships on the spouse. The spouse has to buy black cloth and other items for the funeral and widowhood rites whether she can afford them or not. This creates economic hardship on the spouse if she cannot purchase these items. In some communities, the widow is not allowed to handle money for sometime or shake hands for fear of transferring the bad luck to other people. Another reason for abolishing this outmoded cultural practice is that the painful and harsh aspect of the rite that are unleashed upon the spouse are unnecessary for they do not bring the dead back to life Lastly, widowhood rites should be abolished because forcing the widow to undergo these rites is no real or genuine indication of deep sorrow on the part of the living spouse (wife).",

question: "7a. Define autocratic leadership",
definition: "Autocratic leadership is also referred to as ‘authoritarian’ due to their absolute power and authority. Autocratic leaders tend to be heavily work-centred, placing their emphasis on task accomplishment or achievement and very little on the human element. They wield absolute power over everybody and use threats, instill fear in their followers, take advantages of their authority and personalities to get their own way.",

{
id: "question7b",
question: "7b. Why should autocratic leadership be avoided in a society?",
definition: "Autocratic leadership should be avoided in society due to the following reasons: One, autocratic leaders do not reason with their subordinates and their followers. They initiate decisions single- handedly and do not consult their subordinates for advice. They feel their followers do not have anything good to offer or contribute. Two, leader-follower relationship and interactions are characterized by order giving on the part of the leader. The flow of information between leader-follower is from top to bottom. It is always yes sir’, ‘yes sir, type. Three, autocratic leadership should be abolished because there is extreme dissatisfaction and grumbling among the follower. The followers do not show interest or desire in undertaking any duty or work entrusted to them because of lack of co-operation among the people. Four, autocratic leadership does not allow or encourage active group participation. An autocratic leader does not encourage people to make known their views and opinions or contribute their ideas to solve pertinent problems of the society. There is fear among the people and the result is that good ideas and suggestions are never encouraged to promote active group participation. Five, the absence of the leader normally leads to indiscipline since every individual may wish to go his/her own way. The results can lead to violent and explosive situations like demonstrations or coup d’etats and so on. There is common hatred for the leader. In addition, autocratic leadership leads to high turnover of workers. Autocratic leaders tend to be heavily work-centred but place little emphasis on the human element. Thus workers who are skilled, experienced and needed leave to search for new jobs because nobody wants to work with an autocratic leader who cannot consider the conditions of his workers. Lastly, the general response of the group in most cases is apathy and the work allotted them is not properly done. The absence of the leader may give the workers more room to lazy about and use the working hours for their own benefit. This may reduce productivity.",

question: "8. Discuss the benefits that are derived from the practice of democracy",
definition: "Democracy is the system of government by the whole population usually through elected representatives. The following are some of the benefits that are derived from the practice of democracy: One, democracy ensures respect for individual rights. The individual is free to exercise his rights to secure for himself the fullest development of his personality and the enjoyment of life. These rights include freedom of speech, association, assembly, and worship, to do any lawful work and acquire property. These rights enable the individual to enjoy the social order and they are clearly stated in the ” constitution. Any attempt to interfere with the individual human rights either by the government or any other individual can be contested in court as unconstitutional. Two, democracy ensures orderly transfer of power. Opportunity exists for effecting a change of government through the ballot box. Democracy therefore ensures smooth and peaceful change of government through the electoral system rather than through violent means. In Ghana, power is transferred from one government to another through a term of office, which takes a duration of four years. Three, democracy prevents dictatorship. Since democratic government allows participatory democracy it prevents the ruling government form becoming dictatorial. The government cannot be in power arbitrary because decisions are taken by the majority and the rules and regulations by which a democratic country is to be ruled are clearly stated in a constitution and followed. This means that the constitution makes it possible for power not to be concentrated in the hands of only one organ or institution of government. Four, democracy ensures exchange of ideas and views of critical issues. This atmosphere of free expression enables the citizens of the country to exchange ideas freely and other constructive criticisms and suggestions in as much as what people say and write cut across party lines. Five, in democratic government there is a safeguard against concentration of power. A democratic government operates on the basis of separation of powers. This places a check on undue executive power. Also, various institutions and mechanisms exist to support the democratic system and to safeguard the rights and liberty of the individual. They include an independent judiciary to interpret the laws and act as defender of the rights of the individual. Six, democracy promotes accountability and transparency. The periodic elections held under democratic rule remind rulers that if they do not rule well, and satisfy the aspirations of the people they will be rejected in the next elections. In Ghana, the National Democratic Congress (NDC) was voted out of government in the 2000 elections by the New Patriotic Party (NPP) because people needed a change in the administration of the country. Seven, political participation in democratic government is on the basis of equality. All citizens are equal before the law and have equal opportunity to participate in the political process e.g. voting. There is no discrimination on the basis of sex, education, tribe and property or wealth owned. Participation in the political process also takes the form of taking part in election on the basis of universal adult suffrage, holding office as a member of parliament. Eight, democratic government generates interest in national affairs. The healthy competition among political parties, free expression of views and free criticism of the ruling government enable citizens to take much interest in national affairs and participate in government. Lastly, democracy ensures adequate representation of all. All identifiable groups in the legislature including the minority are adequately represented.",

{
id: "question9b",
question: "9b. Discuss how human resource can be developed for national advancement.",
definition: "One of the ways human resource can be developed is through education. Education enables an individual to acquire knowledge in various fields, which he can use for national development. For example education enables an individual worker to be instructed in attitudes, skills and) knowledge necessary for the job that he is learning. Another way of developing human resource for national advancement is training people for work. The trainee is taught practically the rudiments of the trade or profession. Thus through training, one acquires knowledge, skills and attitude for a specific purpose or job. An individual needs to be trained by specialists in his chosen field to help him contribute effectively to national development. Someone who is interested in nursing can never become a professional nurse if he does not undergo training in a nursing school. Re-training is another way of developing human resources for national advancement. Human resource can be developed by retraining people who have been displaced from work to either obtain new jobs or be on their own. Retraining enables the worker to learn new jobs, new skills and broaden his outlook and understanding of job. For example, typists in many offices which use manual typewriters have been re-trained to handle computers and other office machines. Human resource can be developed through in-service training. Special training courses may be organised for workers where new methods and technology may be introduced to workers. This enables workers to discard outmoded or outdated ideas or methods about their work. Organised visits are another way by which human resource can be developed. Workers of an institution/organisation can visit workers of other organisations/institutions and vice versa. These visits enable workers exchange ideas with their counterparts from other organisations, learn from them and find out various ways of solving certain common problems. Lastly, career counselling or development is another way of developing human resource for national advancement. Through encouragement and support an individual can be advised to make the right choices in life at the right time and place. This will cable the individual to know his potentialities and develop them. He can now be self reliant and independent in choosing the right profession or job.",

question: "10. Discuss five problems of economic development in Ghana.",
options: "\
1. High cost of living: Rapid population growth may put pressure on food supplies. Ghana’s population growth is about 3 percent while the rate of growth of the economy is about 2.6 percent. With this trend of affairs there is no corresponding increase in the available goods and services produced, food shortages may develop and lead to high food prices and services produced. This situation may lead to inflation and bring about high cost of living.\n\n\
2. Low living capacity of the individual: In Ghana there is rapid increase in population, which results in high dependent population. The effect of this is an increase in expenditure on baby foods, drugs, school equipment, housing clothing, health service etc. Since the worker has to spend greater proportion of his income on his dependants he has little money left for savings. With little savings there is low investment and low national income\n\n\
3. Low capital formation: Economic development in Ghana is hindered because of the difficulty of raising capital (domestic or foreign) for investment purposes. Many entrepreneurs derive small profits from their businesses and so unable to save enough money for expanding their enterprises. Raising loans from the banks is difficult because many entrepreneurs cannot offer collateral security against their loans. Ghana’s Stock Exchange is under-developed and not many people who are rich even know the importance of buying shares in a company.\n\n\
4. Low income: Many Ghanaian workers receive low income as wages, farmers and entrepreneurs also receive low incomes from their businesses. The capital base of many businesses are low due to low output which generate low income and savings for the businesses. With low output from businesses workers will receive low income which will be inadequate to maintain their family. For example, low level of farm incomes makes it difficult for farmers to get sufficient money to hire labour, buy up-to-date agricultural equipment like tractors, combine harvester, fertilizers etc. to increase output.\n\n\
5. Adverse terms of trade: Terms of trade refer to the ratio of export prices to import prices. The terms of trade of Ghana have been worsening over the years due to falling prices of their exports which are mainly primary products while the prices of imports of manufactured goods from the advanced countries have been increasing. This unfavorable term of trade usually, leads to persistent balance of payment problems and heavy borrowing and commitment to creditors.\n\n\
6. Heavy dependence on primary commodities: The economy of Ghana is heavily dependent on primary products like cocoa, timber, gold, yams, fish, bananas etc. Cocoa formerly the major export product until recently contributed between 65 and 80 per cent of the country’s foreign exchange carings and provided between 30 and 40 per cent of total government earnings and also contributed 12 per cent to G.D.P. The heavy dependence on one or few export primary products means that if their world prices fall, the economy is seriously affected. Over the years the prices of primary products have been fluctuating on the world market while the prices of machinery and equipment, fertilizers and other manufactured goods keep on increasing. Cocoa prices continued their declining trend after 1989 as a result of chronic over production. For example in Ghana in 1986, cocoa earned the country US $579.2 million while in 1990 it fetched only US $300 million. In terms of percentage share of total exports, cocoa’s share fell from 67.1 percent to 40.5 percent during the same period.\n\n\
7. Inordinate taste for foreign goods: Many Ghanaian entrepreneurs or businessmen have acquired foreign tastes and way of life and therefore spend a lot of money in buying expensive cars, building luxurious houses with expensive furnishing. Such extravagant show of wealth does lead to capital formation for investment. The influence of foreign style and way of life and excessive desire for foreign goods has affected our consumption pattern to the extent that our local markets are flooded with foreign goods. As a result Ghana has become distributors of foreign goods to the neglect of local production of similar goods.\n\n\
8. Low technical and management skills: Ghana lacks highly skilled scientists, engineers, managers etc. Institutions which provide such skills like technical, vocational, polytechnics and the universities are few as such there is a shortage of skilled workers (e.g.) technicians, surveyors, skilled plasterers and bricklayers and trained engineers, managers and scientists. Ghana’s system of education emphasizes more on white-collar job as against technical and vocational education, which can train more technicians and middle level manpower for the country’s development, Low skilled personnel cannot adopt modern methods of production and as a result productivity in industries, agriculture, etc. cannot grow.\n\n\
9. Improper planning: Ghana lacks detailed data and information on her economies and this is due to inexperience of planners who cannot give a detailed analysis of projects. Developments are therefore slowed down because of bad economic management by the government. This result is the rapid rise in the costs of projects compared to the original estimates.\n\n\
10. High rate of illiteracy: There is a low literacy, particularly, adult literacy. There are few schools and educational institutions, thus only a small percentage of the population is able to have even primary education. High rate of illiteracy is the result of people’s low capability to improve on their living conditions by adopting modern methods of production as a means of raising their income levels.\n\n\
11. Negative attitude to work: Most workers do not show interest and enthusiasm in the work that they have been employed to do. They, therefore, regard government work as something that they should not put in their best. It is not uncommon to see many workers going to work late or absenting themselves from work or using working hours to work lotto. In the traditional set up, it is a taboo for either a farmer or fisherman to go to farm or sea on certain prohibited days of the week.\n\n\
12. Nepotism: Favouritism and corruption can hinder development. If the best- qualified person is not appointed to do a job, the work done will be inefficient. Officials and businessmen, at times, use money belonging to a firm or the government for themselves.\n\n\
13. Depreciation of the cedi: Depreciation takes the form of a reduction in the external value of a country’s currency through the forces of demand and supply. Ghana depends on primary products the supply of which tends to be inelastic. Depreciation therefore cheapens the export of primary exports like cocoa, timber, gold, etc. on the world market. Ghana is not able to expand output to take advantage of the country’s import bill because our demand for imported goods is inelastic"
