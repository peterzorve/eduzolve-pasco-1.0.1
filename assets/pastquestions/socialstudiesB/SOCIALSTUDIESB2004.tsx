question: "1. In what ways does the family contribute to nation building.",
definition: "The family contributes to nation building in the following ways:",
options: "\
1. Stable families produce a stable nation needed for national development, Families that are consistent with their roles or functions experience minimum conflict, confusion, destruction, law violations etc. Such families will be stable and produce children who do not become deviants in the society. Stable families will enjoy harmony, peace, happiness etc. that will be required to undertake their daily activities. Children from stable families will develop good character training and become useful members of the nation who can contribute their quota to national development. Such a child will grow up as an obedient person who can work anywhere in the country without practicing negative attitude towards work.\n\n\
2. The family helps in inculcating moral values and norms needed at national level. Through socialization the family imparts the moral values and norms of the society to its members. The child obtains moral behaviour at home and this helps him / her to live peacefully with his / her fellow members in the society. The child also learns in the family that it is against the customary practices of the society for young people to insult their elders. This moral behaviour enables the child to become a moral upright adult who will respect his superiors at his / her work place. The family also inculcates moral values such as honesty, sense of time, sense of regret, courage, bravery, hard work etc. to the family members. These values help to shape the child’s behaviour as he grows up. This will enable family members to live peacefully with their neighbours, which can bring about a better enabling environment for production to take place.\n\n\
3. The family provides education as well as financial support for its members to acquire formal education to the highest level. Some families train their members to become able sportsmen and women before they become national assets. Family support for its members in educational institutions has helped to cut down government expenditure on people attending universities, technical institutes, vocational schools, polytechnics, secondary schools etc. This has helped to produce people who can take up high positions in various occupations in the country. The support provided by the family enables family members to acquire knowledge, skills and attitudes that are later employed in government departments, private organizations, hospitals, universities etc. as administrators, accountants, engineers, lecturers, doctors, nurses and many others. Farmers who acquire formal education can better adopt better farming practices to increase output.\n\n\
4. The family provides vocational training (skills). The child learns the basic household chores like sweeping, cooking, washing etc. Families that are farmers, carpenters, tailors, dressmakers, traders etc. teach their children these skills. In farming communities children learn farming from their parents. Some families have family occupation like fishing. Members of the family may be trained to be fisherman and fish mongers. Chop bar keepers start their business without any formal education but use the knowledge acquired in cooking to operate their business. Once the child acquires vocational training he/she does not become a liability to the nation and the family but can use the skills and knowledge acquired at home to start a business to increase the national output. By providing family members with vocational training, the family reduces the government expenditure on the provision of jobs for everybody since through provision of skills by the family, many people can be self-employed. The problem of unemployment is reduced and national output is increased.\n\n\
5. The family fulfils its function of procreation to ensure continuity of the national community. Procreation guarantees the survival of the human race. Every family system is responsible for producing new members for the society to make sure that the family doesn’t die off. Through procreation the family is able to replace dead members of the society. Through this process new members enter the society and acquire adult roles, which qualify them to marry and give birth to children. The new members increase the population of the national community. As a result, the labour force is increased when members acquire formal and information education.\n\n\
6. Leadership qualities such as honesty, loyalty, tolerance etc. are nurtured at home. Young members of the family are taught leadership qualities such as honesty, loyalty, tolerance etc by their parents to prepare them for their future role in the community. The roles they play are dictated by the age, sex and health of the child, Girls generally help in house chores and through child care practices assist with the feeding and washing of the younger siblings. The girl is therefore prepared for her future adult role as a mother who will take care of her home. In the family children who are targeted as potential kings or abusuapanyin are given special training to prepare them for their future position. The current Asantehene, Otumfuo Osei Tutu is an example. It is recorded that while schooling at Swefi Wiawso he stayed at the Chiefs palace where he received training in chieftaincy matters. This therefore prepared him adequately for ascending the Asante throne when it became vacant\n\n\
7. Obligations and responsibilities at the family level prepare the Individual for national building. Family members are obliged to contribute to funeral expenses of the family and must be willing to pay their taxes and other fees needed for providing hospitals; schools, clinics, toilets, water, electricity etc. for the development of the nation. In the home, family chores like sweeping, washing, cooking utensils, dusting etc, are shared so that every child will know his/her responsibility in the home. This will prepare the child to know the importance of sharing things will other people whether at home or at the work place. Another obligation of the family is taking part in communal labour like weeding the bushy parts of the town and undertaking clean-up exercise, which help the family members to know the importance of self-help. It is also the obligation and responsibility of the family to provide food shelter and clothing for members of the family. This will enable the individual to know that is his/her responsibility to take care of the needs of his/her children when he/she becomes an adult and marry."

question: "2. Discuss the need for reproductive health education among adolescents.",
options: "\
1. Reproductive health helps the adolescents to cope with the emotional problems or stress associated with the period of adolescence. The early part of adolescence is a stage of heightened emotionality. The adolescent begins to experience heightened feelings. Adolescents develop emotional attachments to friends of the opposite sex. Boys start getting interested or attached to girls and appear to have a great appetite for sex. Through reproductive health education, the adolescent is taught how to control his / her emotions or feelings. This will enable the adolescent to know that at the adolescent stage the attraction to the opposite sex is very strong and he can make a girl pregnant if he indulges in pre-marital sex.\n\n\
2. Reproductive health education helps adolescents to acquire knowledge of the physical and physiological changes or development during the period of adolescence. During the period of adolescence, the body proportion changes. The pelvis of girls becomes broadened in preparation for child bearing and their waist becomes circular. Boys increase in height, weight and muscle mass, develop round shoulders, broad chest and the voice becomes deeper and hoarse. These changes that occur at adolescence show that the child is entering adolescence or adulthood. It is these changes that the girl believes she is a woman and the boy a man. It is therefore necessary that the adolescents are taught the reproductive health education so that they know how the reproductive system function and also know the changes taking place in their body and how to encounter these changes.\n\n\
3. Reproductive health education helps in the acquisition of knowledge of personal hygiene or lo take good care of their reproductive parts. There is the need for the adolescent to be taught to keep their bodies clean, neat and healthy. For example, during menstruation, girls are taught to use sanitary towels or cotton wool pads to prevent staining their clothes. The girls are also taught to change the pads regularly and take their bath to prevent unpleasant body odour or smell. The girls are also taught the dispose off the used pads properly. Through reproductive health education the adolescent girl will know that menstruation is not a sickness and that she should do her normal housework or school activities without fear or worry.\n\n\
4. Reproductive health education provides sex education on the female and male reproductive organs or reminds them of their gender. The adolescent needs to be reminded of their gender so that they know the functions of the male and female reproductive organs: The boy needs to know that at puberty the penis and testes (testicles) begin to enlarge. The testes, handing in their little bag, the scrotum, below the penis begin to make sperms, which are the male sex cells: If one of these calls Joins the female egg, thin the girl becomes pregnant and a baby begins to grow. Inside the girl, changes take. place. The girl must know that she is born with all the sex organs she requires to become a mother in future. However, these organs do not work until the girl reaches adolescent stage, then they begin to develop. These organs are the uterus, which is also called the comb, the ovaries and fallopian tubes. The adolescent must be made to understand that since his/ her reproductive organs become matured at that stage, the boy can easily make a girl pregnant. The know ledge of sex education will enlighten the adolescent to know the dangers ahead jf he/she indulges in pre-marital sex.\n\n\
5. Reproductive health education helps prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs). STIs are acquired through sexual intercourse, STIs like gonorhea, syphilis, HIY/AIDS have taken the lives of a lot of people The adolescent should be laugh to abstain from sex and live a chaste life till he / she marries. This will enable the adolescent to eliminate such reproductive health risks as sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV /AIDS. The youth will, therefore, not be exposed to the dangers of STIs and then their lives will be preserved and the country will benefit by employing their services as workers for national development.\n\n\
6. Reproductive health education helps in preventing teenage pregnancy and its attendant problems like illegal abortion, maternal mortally etc. Girls must be educated on the effects of early pregnancy. They must know that when they get pregnant early they may develop complications of pregnancy and labour because of their small pelvis which may warrant an operation to be performed to assist delivery. If the teenager resorts to abortion by using herbs, chemicals or by going to a quack doctor, she may bleed to death or may have infection of the tubes, which may lead to sterility. When the adolescent is taught reproductive health education she will strife to lead a chaste life. He/ she will not engage in pre-marital sex since most teenage pregnancies are the result of ignorance on the part of the adolescent. Such a teenager will bring honour to herself/ himself, parents and the society lf she he lives a chaste life, The teenage mother’s education may be terminated and her aim in life of becoming’s doctor, nurse, teacher may be shattered.\n\n\
7. Reproductive health education helps in providing knowledge on family planning. Adolescents often do not know how sex is related to pregnancy, what contraceptives are and how to use them, The knowledge they have may come from mass media and from friends and is frequently incomplete, misleading or wrong. Schools should teach the school children the importance of reproductive health through organized symposia, talks, debate, open forum and film shows. Parents must decide to allow their teenage daughters who are involved in sexual activities to seek family planning advice and if possible use contraceptives. When the teenager does not have enough idea on family planning she may give birth to many children who may be a burden on the mother and the father, This can affect the health of the baby and the mother since the mother may not recover very well before the next pregnancy. Knowledge about family planning can help the teenager to space her birth when she marries.\n\n\
8. It helps to maintain good health e.g, through good nutrition: The adolescents need to know about their reproductive features so that they can eat good food which will make them grow properly and not have stunted growth. The adolescent should eat balanced diet for the necessary maintenance and care of the body. Eating good food builds the body. Balanced diet contains the necessary protein for the defences of the body. The sources of protein are meat, eggs and milk. Other nutrients are carbohydrates, fats, and oil minerals (e.g, calcium, phosphorus, iron, iodine), vitamins, water and roughage. These nutrients are necessary for the body to grow and function well."

id: "question3",
question: "3. Discuss four ways of achieving higher levels of productivity among Ghanaian workers",
options: "\
1. Higher levels of productivity among Ghanaian workers can be achieved by increasing workers’ remuneration (wages and salaries) and incentives. Wages and salaries are the reward for the services of labour. The wages and salaries paid to labour affect the level of productivity, Higher and attractive wages plus appropriate incentives like attractive retiring benefits, loan facilities, free transportation to and from work, subsidized meals, free medical treatment, car loans, best worker awards etc. motivate and induce workers to work harder or put in their best. A company at the end of a good year can distribute bags of rice, soap, oil etc. to its workers. When this is done, the workers will work very hard in the coming year to ensure that they receive these things again, bench productivity is increased. In Ghana, since the institution of Best Farmer Awards’, farmers have increased their production through diversification and plantation farming. The low level of productivity among Ghanaian workers can be attributed partly to the low wages and salary’s structure. This discourages workers and makes them loose the vigour and interest to work harder. In order to increase the productivity level of the Ghanaian worker, Trade Unions must effectively bargain for attractive wages and salaries levels to induce workers to put in more effort.\n\n\
2. Provision of better working environment / Better working conditions is one of the way of achieving higher levels of productivity among Ghanaian workers. Working conditions entail safety, health and welfare measures provided for the worker. In Ghana, the working environment is appalling Some of the work places lack toilet, canteen, first-aid, and recreational facilities. This makes the worker feel uncomfortable at the work place. To ensure high level of productivity among Ghanaian workers, employers must provide safety measures like protective clothing, head helmets, books, first aid items etc. for workers. Workers who work in a hot, humid, and stuffy office would feel very uncomfortable, hence they will work slowly. But when provided with fans, and air conditioners, they feel comfortable and can work well without unnecessary mistakes, Employers should also take keen interest in the health and welfare of workers. Again, to increase workers productivity, there should be adequate ventilation, lighting and healthy sanitation, places of convenience, fire alarms and extinguishers. Adequate space and accommodation for staff should be provided for workers to move with ease. Overcrowding must, therefore, be avoided since this affects the efficiency and health. There should be recreational facilities to reduce fatigue and boredom. The provision of better health services like clinics is necessary because a healthy would be able to work well whereas a sick worker is likely to fall sick thus reducing labour productivity.\n\n\
3. To achieve higher levels of productivity among Ghanaian workers management must ensure that workers use modern equipment, for example, new machine / technology. The introduction and use of modern machines and equipment in the work setting helps to improve the productivity of the worker. To achieve higher productivity, the right type of tools, machinery and equipment should be provided in work places in sufficient quantities. Firms, which use the computer instead of the manual typewriter can type faster and efficiently. Computers can store and retrieve information without delay than to use the manual typewriter. As a result, the use of computers at work places has helped to increase the worker’s level of productivity.\n\n\
4. The provision of relevant education is necessary for Ghanaian workers to achieve higher levels of productivity. Labour becomes productive when it is well educated and trained for specific job. The Universities, polytechnics, technical institutes, vocational schools, etc. provide education in specific skills to students to make them employable Less emphasis should be placed on white colour type of education. Since the world is changing very fast education must be relevant to the changing needs of the nation. As a result new strategies and techniques must be adopted. With the introduction of computer into the Ghanaian economy, which is highly efficient than the manual typewriter, many educational institutions teach computing to their students to make them computer literate.\n\n\
5. Provision of on-the-job training for workers helps to improve the skills of workers. Training within industry enables workers to handle particular machine properly and for work to be done correctly. This means that old workers should be retrained in order to refresh their memories and new workers given on-the-job training to keep them abreast with the skills of the job. This will help the workers to be skilled for productivity to increase. In addition, seminars, workshops, etc. should be organized periodically for all level of workers to improve their skills and labor productivity. Seminars and refresher courses organised by GIMPA Legon, Management Development and Public Administration as well as Ghanaian Enterprises Development Commission have helped to improve the skills of workers. In-service training, workshops and refresher programmes will enhance workers efficiency, This will also give them the opportunity to meet other colleagues from other firms and share ideas together. This will go a long way to increase productivity, On the job training enables the worker gain knowledge about his / her job and apply it to increase productivity. Again, a worker who is promoted can be made to understudy his senior officer to acquire more knowledge on his new position. Employers must initiate training schemes to train workers to acquire computer skills, which will enable them to operate them to achieve higher productivity at their work places.\n\n\
6. To increase workers’ product. rity there must be effective communication between management and employees(workers). Management must involve workers in decision-making. Delegation of authority and involvement of workers in decision- making can increase workers productivity, Delegation is the transfer of authority and responsibility from superior to subordinates. In the Ghanaian labour force, top management personnel feel too bossy and hence refuse to delegate work and also decentralise decision -making. This situation demoralizes workers. Human beings in general are very sensitive to laws and will like to take part in decisions that will offer him/her. In order to increase the level of motivation and make workers feel that their well-being and future are tied to the survival of the organisation, workers would be prepared to increase their output. Delegation of authority must be encouraged and workers involvement in decision making motivate them to put in their best in the job that they are doing. Decisions taken by employers or management should therefore not be imposed on workers. They should be part of the decision making process of the organization. When workers are allowed in determining the working process of the organisation, they become committed to the work they are assigned to do. This is because the success or failure of the business will rest on them and to avoid this they will work harder. Worker participation in decision-making motivates them to put in their best in the job that they are doing.\n\n\
7. Provision of effective supervision helps in increasing workers’ productivity. In Ghana supervisors are also not highly motivated because of poor remuneration, nepotism etc. They themselves come to work late and cannot query their subordinates who come to work late. Supervisors must therefore ensure effective supervision at all times. They must always be on the look out for signs of laziness, unnecessary loitering, working of lotto during working hours so that man-hours lost due to these negative attitudes can be used to increase workers’ productivity. Time book, which takes account of the time workers report at work and close can be introduced to check workers attendance. This document should closely monitored by the supervisor and those found to be habitual latecomers queried.\n\n\
8. Another way of achieving higher levels of productivity in Ghana is to ensure effective communication between management and employees (workers). Policies formulated by management should be dissipated to workers through appropriate communication channels. Management must promote good management – worker relationship. This means there that management must have a cordial and serene relationship with their workers. Management must be approachable, friendly and sympathetic towards their workers so that they can discuss their problems with them. Also, management should be sensitive to the plight of workers and seek to resolve conflicts between management and employees through arbitration and dialogue so as to prevent confrontation and industrial actions or strikes by workers. Recently, employees of some companies have taken to the streets, because that seemed the only way to make management sensitive to their plight. These actions only waste productive time and sometimes cause damage to company property, and so this should be avoided. Management must also identify the needs of workers and satisfy them to reduce apathy and increase workers productivity. The exercise of effective management control is, therefore, needed in all establishments to increase output.\n\n\
9. To increase productivity, workers must develop positive work attitudes. Improvement in attitude to work is very essential. Many workers have the wrong attitude to work because they have the impression that additional output or profit only benefits the ‘Government’ and not the workers themselves. Laziness, lateness, absenteeism, embezzlement, falsification of accounts, drunkenness and working lottery during working hours are some of the poor work ethics exhibited at work places by Ghanaian workers. To raise productivity workers should be educated to show a change in these negative attitudes to work and inculcate new and positive attitude towards work to enhance productivity.\n\n\
10. Better management practices/Provision of effective entrepreneurship. There is the need to ensure sound and efficient management practices at the various work places to increase productivity. Managers of business must be trained and have regular re-training and must also attend workshops, seminars, management courses to update their managerial skills. If a business is managed by a well-trained personnel he/she will be able to supervise his/her subordinates to exact maximum productivity from them.\n\n\
11. Promotion of transparent political atmosphere is necessary to ensure political stability. Political instability in the form of coups, ethnic conflict, and civil wars disturbs the orderly process of government and affects economic stability of the country. Smooth change in government, absence of coups, ethnic conflicts or civil wars ensures congenial atmosphere for workers to increase output without the fear of war looming over them. Under this condition worker productivity can be increased, as management will be prepared to invest more capital into the business since their investment will be protected."

id: "question4",
question: "4. Discuss the need for citizens to honour their tax obligations to the state.",
definition: "The rights and privileges that citizens enjoy are accompanied by duties and obligations. There is the need for citizens to honour their tax obligations since it is a responsibility. It is our right to use government properties like roads, bridges, railways etc. to convey goods, or materials, people etc. And in the same way citizens have equal responsibility to pay their taxes so that the government will be able to maintain these facilities and construct more of them to facilitate the country’s development.",
options: "\
1. Citizens enjoy economic, social and political rights which are achieved through public funds derived through tax payment. For example, a convicted citizen can receive free legal aid at the courts because he / she cannot pay the services of a lawyer. The services of the lawyer must be supported with money, which comes from tax payment. This ensures that both the poor and rich receive fair hearing at the courts.\n\n\
2. Citizens need to honor their tax obligations to the state to enable it provide infrastructural facilities such as schools, hospitals, roads, bridges etc. For example, District Assemblies generate revenue from taxes eg. market fees, lorry park tolls, property tax, basic rate etc. The tax proceeds are used to maintain roads, build new roads, maintain and build bridges to facilitate the movement of foodstuff from the farms to the urban centres. If citizens do not pay their taxes all these community facilities cannot be provided by the government.\n\n\
3. The provision of social amenities such as electricity, water, education, housing, medical services etc. can be made possible when citizens honour their tax obligation to the state. Taxes levied by District Assemblies are used for environmental cleanliness such as providing waste disposal containers and ensuring healthy sanitary conditions. Taxes collected are used to provide potable water for the rural areas so that they do not drink dirty water. When people in the rural areas are provided with clean water they will not contract guinea worm disease and can go about their farming activities with ease. These social amenities have gone a long way to improve the living conditions of the people in the rural areas.\n\n\
4. When citizens honour their tax obligation to the state it is used to pay the salaries and wages of government employees. In many District Assemblies, for example, taxes collected like market tolls, lorry park tolls, basic rate, property rate etc.are used for the payment of salaries and allowances of the assembly members. Taxes are also used to pay the allowances of permanent and casual labourers employed by the Assembly.\n\n\
5. Money is made available for investment in agriculture, industries, and mining when citizens honour their tax obligation to the state. The proceeds from taxes that the government levies on goods imported and exported, company tax, excise duty, income tax etc.are used in farming projects, cottage industries (e.g. gari processing, soap making and palm oil processing). These projects help in providing employment opportunities for the local people and also serve as a source of income for the people.\n\n\
6. Citizens of a country are obliged to honour their tax obligations so that the state can pay its external and internal debts. Internal debts are owed to the citizens of a country as a result of loans contracted by the state through the sale of securities like treasury bills and bonds to the citizens of the country. External debts, on the other hand, are owed to foreign countries and international organizations like the World Bank, IMF etc. All these debts have to be paid through taxes levied on citizens of the country. It is only when citizens honour their tax obligations that these loans can be paid. By paying these loans they enable the state to become credit worthy so that she can enjoy further loans from the developed countries and multi national institutions.\n\n\
7. If citizens honour their tax obligation to the state this will enable the government to pay subventions to institutions, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) for research programmes etc. State enterprises, which lack funds to buy raw materials, machines, undertake maintenance and repairs or pay their staff depend on government tax revenue to undertake these activities. Non governmental organizations which undertake activities in orphanage, vocational skills, HIV / AIDS programmes etc. from time to time receive money from the government to support their activities."

id: "question5",
question: "5. Explain the role of the mass media in the socialization process of an individual.",
options: "\
1. Provision of information on social, political, religious, education and economic events. The mass media provides information which helps the individual to change his / her behaviour or way of life. In the Daily Graphic of August 30, 2004 Prof. (Mrs.) Naana Opoku-Agyeman, the Dean of Graduate Studies of the University of Cape Coast expressed concern at the indecent mode of dressing of many young women, particularly, female students and called on mothers to help curb the practice. Also, many people have understood the importance of these policies and have seen the benefits in the poverty reduction strategy programme pursued by the government. In the daily papers, particularly, Daily Graphic has stated that ¿24.48 billion of the HIPIC benefit had been allocated by the Government to the Ministry of Education to upgrade 31 senior secondary schools into model schools throughout the country.\n\n\
2. The mass media provides education by imparting knowledge to the individual. The mass media broadcasts educative programmes on radio and television. Television stations like the Metro TV and GTV have educational programmes like Brilliant Science Quiz, What do you know?, Schools broadcast on subjects like Mathematics, Science, English etc. Junior Graphic has a section devoted to Puzzles, storey telling solutions to BECE and SSSCE past questions. Junior Graphic also publishes comments on Chief Examiner’s report on the performance of students in BECE and SSSCE. As a result students are able to acquire knowledge related to their subject area and this has helped many them to improve on their academic performance. Also, through the news papers and television programmes, the youth have acquired knowledge on reproductive health education, family life education and family planning; this has helped the youth not to indulge in pre-marital sex. The President’s Special Initiative on Distant Learning and Adult Education, which is televised on the GTV go a long way to educate citizens who cannot afford to go into educational institutions for one reason or the other. This has helped to increase the number of literates in the country.\n\n\
3. The mass media provides entertainment for the people. The national and private newspapers and television stations entertain people to both local and foreign entertainment programmes like “Bold and Beautiful”, “Dada Boat”, “Cantata”, “Tentacles” etc. Metro TV and GTV entertain the Ghanaian public to different types of songs and dancing from different ethnic Ghanaian society. The television also entertains people with folk tales and poetry.\n\n\
4. The mass media also plays a vital role in imparting or acquiring the cultural values of the people. Through the mass media many Ghanaians have been able to learn the culture of their traditional areas. For example, the Dagombas, Nanombas and the Mamprusis celebrate the Bugum festival to remember the day they found the lost son of the great chief. Again, through television and, newspaper publications etc. many Ghanaians have learnt that the Ewes celebrate Hogbetsotso festival to commemorate the time their forefathers ran away from their cruel chief Agokoli. The national newspapers carry pictures of the celebration of cultural events like cultural festivals while the radio FM and television stations run commentaries during the celebration of festivals of he various ethnic groups. The role of the mass media in the socialization process of an individual has helped to impart the tradition of the people from one generation to another and the youth to internalize the cultural values of the people .The newspapers and television stations show positive cultural practices like naming ceremonies, funeral rites, puberty rites and at the same time produce articles against the negative cultural practices like the trokosi, female genital mutilation (FGM), widowhood rites etc.\n\n\
5. The mass media provides skill training to the people. The mass media teaches the women how to prepare local and foreign dishes using Magi Cube and Star Kist. The national paper has a column showing the recipes for the preparation foreign and local dishes. Magi Cube sponsors good cooking with Magi Cube on GTV. Qualified caterer demonstrates the preparation of local and foreign dishes with Magi Cube. TV3, for example, has a programme called “Royco Asanka Delight” which shows the preparation of special dishes by a qualified caterer with Royco.\n\n\
6. The mass media provides attitudinal changes. That is, the mass media contributes to the moral change of the people through television programmes and articles that people write in the newspapers. The television shows documentaries on HIV /AIDS and drug addiction. The aim of such documentaries is to let people see the effects of HIV /AIDS and drug abuse so that people can change their moral behaviour. The radio and FM stations present programmes that advise people to change their attitude towards HIV / AIDS victims and accept them into the community. Through the mass media many people have changed their moral habits."

id: "question6",
question: "6. Explain four measures that can be taken to make the prisons in Ghana better reformative homes for inmates.",
options: "\
1. Adequate logistics and materials for effective vocational training. If prisoners are to be properly integrated into the society after their release from prisons, then they should be provided with vocational training in tie-dye, soap making, dressmaking, tailoring, painting, carpentry,masonry etc. Prisoners should be provided with materials like sewing machines so that when the inmates are released they can use them to start their own business. In addition to sewing, the inmates: can be provided with carpentry and masonry tools, hair dressing materials, soap and pomade making materials so that they can use them to earn a living. When prisons are provided with these logistics for vocational training they will acquire employable skills, which will make them employable. When prisoners acquire these skills and they are released from the prisons they will not be a burden on the society but can either start their own business or be employed by other people. This will not only make the inmates well equipped after their release from the prisons but also make them appreciate that there is dignity in hard work.\n\n\
2. Pragmatic policies to rehabilitate prisoners after serving prison terms. Another measure that can be taken to make the prisons in Ghana better reformative homes for inmates is by drawing up of a programme for formulation of pragmatic policies to rehabilitate prisoners after serving prison terms. This means that whilst the prisoner is in prison he / she should acquire vocational skills. Most crimes are committed by the unemployed people in the country. It is therefore necessary that prisoners are made to learn a trade or vocations like painting, carpentry, masonry, shoe making, tailoring, sewing etc. in the prison so that they come go out as reformed persons. Prisoners who have acquired such skills will not go back to commit the crime again. Many prisoners have talents that are yet to be unearthed when released so they can contribute to national development. For instance, a prisoner on execution list, Gee Man is a transformed man in prison and has formed a group which released an album full of Christian songs. His talent has been unearthed whiles in prison and now has found a purpose for his life in the singing ministry.\n\n\
3. For prisons in Ghana to be better reformative homes for inmates, they should be exposed to religion and moral education. Prisoners should be encouraged to take religious teaching given them seriously while in custody since they can help to reform them. They should also be encouraged to pray for forgiveness of sin and know that God loves them even with their sin and that if they pray fervently to God and repent their sins would be forgiven. The moral lessons learnt from religious teachings will enable them have a better view of themselves since most of them believe they have no aim in life. This believe will enable them to have the urge to do something better with their lives when they are released from prison. Such teachings also help take some of the bitterness they have away knowing that people care to share with them the word of God and pray with them. We have for instance people being ordained pastors even before leaving the prisons as a result of the religious and moral education they receive. Benjilo who was jailed for dealing in drugs was ordained a pastor before his release from prison.\n\n\
4. Through guidance and counselling programme in prisons inmates get reformed. Some people are imprisoned because of fraud, burglary, drug peddling, armed robbery etc. Others go through traumatic experiences making them to commit crimes. Such people need nothing than counselling and guidance. There is no need giving prison inmates harsh treatment but they should be counselled about the hazards that drugs can cause to their lives and urged to do away with all anti social behaviour or deviant acts. Again there is the need to ensure that prisoners get experienced counsellors whom they can trust to share their thoughts and feelings. This creates an outlet for their anger and bitterness against society and eventually make them reform from their bad acts when released. Provision of guidance and counseling programmes in our prisons will help inmates to understand themselves better, make better decisions and decide on what to do next after their release from prisons. This will make them understand that the various crimes they committed were wrong, and also it will enable them understand the need of their punishment. Furthermore, it will allow them to get rid of the bitterness or resentment they have towards people outside the prisons.\n\n\
5. The fundamental human rights of prisoners should be protected. It is necessary that prison officers establish good human relations with prisoners. If prisoners are badly treated they become bitter and harbour wicked ideas even after serving their prison sentence. They should be given enough food to eat and not made to sleep on the bare floor, Prisoners should not be made to urinate and defecate in the same room where they sleep. Prisoners who are tortured and humiliated before their males usually leave the prison walls without any remorse. When prisoners are given humane treatment they begin to look at themselves differently and change from their deviant character so as to earn the respect of the society and consider themselves capable of contributing to national development.\n\n\
6. Ghanaians must be educated to change their bad attitudes towards all ex-convicts. Some prisoners were only framed up, political prisoners, others were innocent of their alleged crimes, which sent them to prison. This category of prisoners should not be regarded as criminals. In Ghana many people have the idea that once a person is an ex-convict, he or she is not fit to be in the society. Therefore people say all kinds of things about them and some are refused recruitment when they apply for job in companies. This makes the harsh economic conditions unbearable for them, therefore, they feel like going back to their old way. In order to prevent this, the government needs to educate the public about the notion they have of ex-convicts but rather to encourage such people to be well integrated into the society to assist in the development of the society.\n\n\
7. Better working conditions for prison officers (personal) can make the prisons in Ghana better reformative homes for inmates. The prison officers must be provided with adequate remuneration and improved conditions of work to enhance their morale. Salaries for the prison personnel must be very attractive so that they are not easily corrupted into taking bribes. Prison officers must be provided with subsidized accommodation and canteen services, risk allowance, hospital allowance to enable them enjoy their work.\n\n\
8. It is necessary to rehabilitate the physical structures in prisons. The physical structures in prisons in Ghana are in very poor state. For example, the prison buildings, which house prisoners, have not been physical expansion for many years despite the increase in inmates. The physical buildings have not been renovated for many years and also lack maintenance. To ensure that prisoners are properly housed, more buildings should be built, the physical buildings must be regularly renovated and maintained to reduce maintenance cost. Toilets and bathrooms, which are in poor state, must be maintained so that the inmates don’t contact any disease. Workshops, which are in poor state, must be rehabilitated to enable the inmate’s use them for their vocational training.\n\n\
9. Prison officers should be given training and re-training programmes for the staff to keep abreast with new changes in the society. To ensure that prison personnel perform better on their job, there is the need to ensure that those employed have formal education, which will form the basis for formal training to take place. Formal training and in-service training will equip the prison officers with modern ideas and skills in the performance of their day-to-day activities. If the prison personnel are trained and re-trained they can handle prisoners with respect and relate well with them so that the prisoners can change their bad ways because of the good character of the prison officers.\n\n\
10. Provision of the required social amenities in the form of health facilities, recreation etc. There are not enough clinics or hospitals located in the prisons to offer medical attention to the inmates. All cases of sickness are usually referred to regional or district hospitals. Prisons lack facilities like table tennis, volley pitch, net-ball pitch, football park, ludo, oware etc. If these facilities are provided, the inmates can learn any of these recreational activities in their spare time. For instance, an inmate’s potential in football may be realized and he might take up that as a profession upon his release and he might become a useful national asset. If the prisons are provided with better housing it will help to reduce the overcrowding in prisons and also help to reduce any health hazards that may develop as a result."

id: "question7",
question: "7. Discuss four challenges of democratic Governance in Ghana.",
options: "\
1. High level of illiteracy: Democracy requires that the citizens be educated politically of their rights and responsibilities to enable them to make good judgments etc. Many people in Ghana are illiterate and partially educated. They cannot make good decisions since they cannot read manifestos of political parties and vote intelligently. Fanaticism, therefore, plays a greater part in the support for political parties. Many people are ignorant of the existence of the country’s constitution and how the organs of government operate. Others are ignorant about the existence of what constitute their rights and responsibilities. This makes the practice of democracy a problem in Ghana. Again, a lot of the people are Illiterates and do not understand electoral procedures, which are a necessity to having successful, free and fair elections. Selfish politicians who speak in languages those stair people’s sentiments easily deceive the people. Illiteracy also makes it difficult to terminate tribalism and so people vote for members of their ethnicity whether his policies are viable or not.\n\n\
2. Irresponsible use of the mass media. Democracy gives undue advantage to people to express their views, sometimes to the detriment of others. Journalists at times take advantage of freedom of press and give citizens false information or make false accusations and claims against governments, which send wrong signals to the citizens. It is not uncommon to hear journalists on the airwaves accuse governments on issues that they themselves are not well informed. If the government in power is one, which does not tolerate varied, then the arrests and maltreatment of journalists affect the democratic governance of the nation. There are instances when journalists have apologized in the national and private newspapers for misreporting the ideas of politicians or misquoting the address of a government official.\n\n\
3. Military Adventurism. Military coup d’etat destroys the progress of a country and sends the country backwards etc. since it fails to conduct elections at required intervals. This violent change in government reverses the institution of democracy and makes it difficult for democracy to take root. Military governments are dictatorial and do not tolerate criticisms from anybody especially the media. Hence, they unlawfully imprison people whom they feel they are a threat to them. This amounts to abuse of the rights of individuals since military interference obviously disrupts the democratic governance of the country.\n\n\
4. Government interference. There is undue interference of the Executive on independent institutions. There is at times when the government interferes in the judiciary to favour those in the ruling party or relations, which violate the independent nature of the judiciary.\n\n\
5. Poverty: The maintenance of government structures in terms of money and resources etc. makes it difficult to operate democratic government machinery. Funds are al ways needed to organize and carry out presidential, parliamentary and district assembly election. This money is sometimes unavailable. Ghana has, for the past years, been relying on donor support to help organize its election, Registration of would-be voters has sometimes been unduely delayed due to lack of funds. This delay does not augur well for effective democratic governance. Democratic governments need financial resources to maintain institutions like the Media Commission, the Council of State and the National Electoral Commission. Various large sums of money are required to carry out voting. Many people have to be employed by the Electoral Commission to serve as polling agents. Professional photographers are employed to demarcate the constituencies for voting purposes. Ballot papers, boxes, and indelible ink are costly necessities of elections. Thus, when politicians are elected into office, they misuse the country’s funds so as to recover what they spent on election campaigning. The expenditure involved in running various committees in Parliament and the organs of government also require a lot of money, Due to lack of financial resources, many parliamentarians cannot maintain permanent offices in their constituencies because they cannot pay the rent and secretaries who will man them.\n\n\
6. Ethnic sentiments in politics: Most government leaders especially those in Africa normally put their tribes men and their relatives in high position and ignore others from other tribes, which breeds hatred and rivalry among the citizens. For example, when an unqualified person is appointed as the head of a government corporation, such a person will mess up the whole organisation. Many Ghanaian leaders tend to be interested in appointing their relatives or party members to man certain key positions. This will mean putting square pegs in round holes. This can breed ethnicity and affect the efficient practice of democracy in the country.\n\n\
7. Misuse of incumbency: The ruling government can use its position in many ways that may put the minority parties at a disadvantage. The incumbent can use state resources to organize campaigns, which may not be able available to the minority parties. In the district levels, the District Chief Executive many also use his / her position to support party activities.8. The relationship between Government and Opposition / Minority Groups: In a democratic system, the majority forms the government. Major decisions affecting the state rest with the government in power. The minority forms the opposition. The minority or opposition is free to make constructive criticism of the policies of the government or express opinions about government policies, By so doing, individuals, and the government benefit. Conflicts arise when the government is so sensitive to criticism that it attempts to override individual rights and freedom. On the other hand, the minority may speak and write in a manner that may promote disaffection in the nation. The government must accommodate the views of minority so that there can be a peaceful environment for democratic governance to take root.\n\n\
9. Conflict between the state and individuals: Where the state infringes on the rights of individuals they are bound to react negatively. They show resentment through strikes, demonstrations etc. Most of the rural folks are attached to their traditional chiefs, Most a times, the laws of our traditional areas contradict with that of the constitution. Example is the human sacrifice practiced in some traditional areas. The people may tend to obey the chiefs and their traditional laws more than the government and the constitution. In view of this, law-implementing agencies should not use force to implement the law of the country so that they do not infringe on human rights of the citizens.\n\n\
10. Conflict between the Executive and Ruling Party: Conflict may also arise between the executive and its own political party. As democracy demands the rule of elected majority, the executive arm of government assumes office on the victory of the party that wins at the pools. A political party uses a manifesto, which outlines programmes of work on assumption of power. The party expects the manifesto to be the guiding principle for the executive. Where the executive does not follow the party’s programmes conflict may arise. Another problem is where party functionaries wish to impose their will on the executive in the discharge of its constitutional functions."

id: "question8",
question: "8. Explain four benefits that Ghana derives from her membership of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).",
options: "\
1. Free movement of capital and persons. With the establishment of ECOWAS there is now free movement of the citizens across the boarders of member states. The protocol of free movement has three phases. These are: \n\t(a)	abolition of tourist visa requirements \n\t(b)	right of residence \n\t(c)	right of establishment. \nThe reason behind this free movement is to help the citizens to know themselves and bring in capital to establish businesses in member states. As a result investors with investible resources are invited into member states including Ghana and invest their capital.\n\n\
2. Creation of large market: The existence of ECOWAS is expected to provide member states like Ghana with an enlarged domestic market within the West African sub-region for goods produced by the member states. ECOWAS will expose the various member states to a large domestic market of more than 160 million people instead of 8 or 12 million as in some small states of West Africa. This will overcome the limitation of small national markets and the low income. West African member countries will be exposed to the enormous marketing opportunity that will be created for those businesses that can expand or tap the enlarged market by ECOWAS. When goods are allowed to move to any part of West Africa freely however the market for these goods will grow and the manufacturing industries producing them will produce on a large-scale.\n\n\
3. Employment creation: Citizens of member states benefit from employment of trained manpower of the organization. The expansion in the size of the market would result in the creation of jobs, which would help reduce the rate of unemployment in West Africa. The jobs would be created as industries expand their production in response to the large market. The setting up of large-scale industries will give employment to skilled labour and the large number of unemployed people of member states that would be allowed free movement and the right to take up employment in any of the member states.\n\n\
4. Another benefit is the industrial and agricultural development programmes for member states. To help improve agriculture and therefore boost food production, the community has adopted an ECOWAS Common Agricultural Policy and Regional Development Strategy. This Programme has identified seven seed multiplication contract to provide the use of improved seed in the sub-region. Eight cattle breeding centres have also been identified and funds being provided to improve the operations of these centres. The community also intended to fight the threat of desertification by re- afforestation. There has been co-operation in technological development, including training technical assistance and exchange of information. A protocol of Community Enterprises has been signed in order to generate business confidence and create a more attractive investment atmosphere in the sub- region.\n\n\
5. Free movement of goods / Increased trade among member states: The abolition of trade restrictions among member states has led to trade with member countries. For example, salt produced in Ghana is exported to member countries like Niger, Nigeria and Burkina Faso. Ghana sells hydroelectric power to Togo and Benin, while at the same time there is an exchange of power between Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire.\n\n\
6. Benefits from peace-keeping activities in member countries: Through ECOWAS member countries have set up a peace force in the form of ECOMOG to help maintain peace and harmony in member countries. Countries like Ghana, Nigeria, Cote d’Ivoire and Guinea have contributed soldiers and logistic support to assist countries like Liberia and Sierra Leone experiencing civil wars.\n\n\
7. Industrial development: Through ECOWAS, construction works on the West African Gas Pipeline project to be owned by the West African Gas Pipeline Company Limited (WAPCo) will supply natural gas from Nigeria to markets in Benin, Ghana and Togo, which will start in November, 2004. This project will ensure delivery of gas by 2006 for both domestic and industrial use. Ghana also benefits from the CIMAO cement project in Togo, which supplies cement to Ghana for construction works.\n\n\
8. Ghana benefits from common solution to socio-economic problems during ministerial and summit conferences. The establishment of a common tariff structure and commercial policy towards other countries will lead better terms of trade. Through ECOWAS member countries will stand as one entity and be in the position to have a more effective bargaining power in world trade. So with their numerical strength and one voice ECOWAS member countries can air their views in international issues affecting member countries and achieve speedy solution. This means that Ghana has got a platform on, which it airs its views are nation on international issues. And with President Kuffour as ECOWAS Chairman, this point is more reinforced.\n\n\
9. Financial facilities: ECOWAS has led to the creation of West African Clearing House (WACH) to settle payments between the member countries in local currency. Outstanding balances at the end of each month are settled. As a result of WACH, ECOWAS has led to the creation of ECOBANK in member countries including Ghana. With the clearing house, Ghana can save her scarce foreign exchange and also facilitate the exchange of currency between member countries. To facilitate trade among member countries, there is going to be in use a common currency called ECO which will put member countries into one West African Monetary Zone."

id: "question9",
question: "9. In what ways do mining activities in the country affect the environment.",
options: "\
1. Economic trees are uprooted easily during storms: Excessive mining activities through the use of heavy machines like bulldozers, excavators, dynamite etc remove minerals from the earth crust thus making the soil less compact. As a result during heavy rainstorms economic trees like timber, cocoa, coffee, palm trees, coconut, citrus fruits etc are easily uprooted and destroyed. This can affect the livelihood of the people in the area. The operation of small-scale miners popularly called ‘galamsey’ also causes the removal of topsoil, which damages the roots of economic trees and become uprooted when there is strong rainstorm.\n\n\
2. Pollution of water bodies: Mining activities pollute sources of water thereby affecting aquatic life. As the water become polluted the fish in the water may be poisoned and die which will deplete the fish resources. The washing of minerals in rivers by small-scale miners pollutes the water body, which serves as a source of drinking water and for other domestic purposes by the people in the community.A lot of dirt and filth is released’ into the water bodies thereby polluting the rivers and the aquatic life in them. Also, in the processing of the ores chemicals like mercury, cyanide etc. are released into the water bodies. The toxic chemical destroys the aquatic life in the river and other organisms that depend on this aquatic life. Apart from the chemicals, sand, gravels and other particles, cause siltation of the water bodies. Water sources in mining communities get contaminated as a result of mining activities like dredging. Some of the particles discharged from the mining industries are mine tailing and other effluents. Others are chemicals like sulphur compounds, sulphur acids etc. The large volume of wastewater, which is muddy, released during the ore washing process of the extraction of manganese and diamond cause water pollution, Some rivers, which are affected, include Rivers Ankobra, Birim, offin, Pra and their tributaries. The spillage of the toxic chemical had resulted in the death of fishes and other aquatic organisms in the river and had affected the communities depending on the river for their livelihood.\n\n\
3. Destruction of vegetation affecting animal life, Mining activities result in deforestation and the extinction of wild species of both plants and animals. During mining activities, the vegetation is cleared, the trees uprooted, and this may destroy the natural habitat of wild animals and birds. Since there is little re-afforestation, some of these species of wild animals and birds become extinct. It is therefore necessary that the mining activities be controlled. Some of the animals even killed in the process of mining the ore.\n\n\
4. Decline in soil fertility: Mining activities lead to the destruction of vegetation, farmlands, forests, riverbeds etc. The operation of mining activities on small-scale miners eventually removes the topsoil, which is rich in soil nutrients. This leads to decline in soil fertility and also causes loss of soil moisture, which results in poor yield from the land or the affected land cannot be used for agricultural production.\n\n\
5. Removal of vegetation causes soil erosion: The open cast method, for example, which is used to obtain minerals, destroys the landscape of the environment. It clears the vegetation completely off the ground, leaves the soil bare, and makes it susceptible to erosion. It is thus common to find deep gullies created by water in these areas, Again, mining activities remove the tope soil exposing it to the high temperatures of the sun. This makes the soil very loose and easily washed away when it rains. The excessive temperatures kill the microorganisms in the soil rendering it infertile and difficult to support plant growth. Since the land cannot support plant growth the sun bakes the bare land, which is then worked on by rain causing erosion.\n\n\
6. The stagnant water breeds mosquitoes: The activities of surface mining popularly called “galamsay’ involve the digging of pits in search of minerals. This has the effect of creating holes and trenches, which are not filled with soil or refuse. As a result water collects in the trenches, when it rains becoming breeding ground for mosquitoes.\n\n\
7. The trenches that develop from mining activities become death traps to human beings as well as animals. The trenches put the life of humans and animals in danger. Animals or human beings who fall into them can loose their lives. Many of these trenches are so deep that when there is excessive rainfall water that collects in them overflow their banks causing flooding, which affect plant and animal life.\n\n\
8. Pollution of the atmosphere: Mining activities may lead to air pollution. In process of mining the ore, dynamite is used to blast the rocks apart to release the ore. The blasting produces a lot of dust particles into the atmosphere thus polluting it. The dust in the air can be so thick that it can impair the sight and breathing of miners and people living in the area. These dust particles and smoke machines can cause respiratory disorders and lung diseases for people living in the mining areas. Dust and smoke can cut down the amount of sunlight reaching plants for photosynthesis thereby leading to reduction of crop yields and retardation of plant growth. Also, the dust particles may even settle on lakes and ponds, covering the surface of the water bodies and prevents atmospheric oxygen from reaching the aquatic life beneath. Again, in the processing of the ore, gases are released into the air, which pollute the atmosphere. Gases like carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide etc. are discharged into the atmosphere. Sulphur dioxide, for instance, combines with water vapour in the air to form acidic rain, which destroys crops and increases the acidity of the soil making the soil infertile.\n\n\
9. Noise Pollution: Noise and vibration that mineral exploration produces have serious effect on the environment. These noises and vibrations are the result of blasting, processing plants, such as air compressors and the grinding mills. This intensive noise could cause auditory problem (i.e. permanent or temporary hearing loss), cardiovascular problems of both the miners and people living around the mining area etc. Most miners use dynamite explosives in their mining activities. This becomes a cause for noise pollution making people differ having impartment and heart problems.\n\n\
10. Mining areas attract a lot of people who come to seek employment in the mines. This leads to heavy population concentration in the mining centres creating slums and its attendant sanitation and waste management problems. The heavy concentration of people in the mining areas put pressure on the available facilities like housing, water, electricity, schools, heal. etc. The development of slums and shanty settlements in the mining areas is the result of improper disposal of refuse, scrap metals, mineral and chemical wastes, which hazardous to humans and plant life.\n\n\
11. In times of earth tremor destruction is very heavy in mining areas. Mining activities involve the use of heavy machines, which go deep into the earth crust to excavate minerals. Since mining exploration may cover large expanse of area, the soil may become very loose and cannot hold plant life. As vegetation is destroyed, trees are uprooted to give way for mineral exploration, the compactness of the land is disturbed and therefore any earth tremor that results may bring about extensive damage to housing, farms, electrical poles, bridges, dams, roads etc in the mining areas."

id: "question10a",
question: "10a. Explain four problems facing private sector enterprises in Ghana.",
options: "\
1. Inadequate financial base: Private sector enterprises in Ghana are hindered because of the difficulty of raising domestic capital for investment. Capital is needed to acquire machinery, pay labour, buy raw materials etc. Many private businessmen derive small profits from their businesses and so unable to save enough money for expanding their enterprises. Raising loans from the banks is difficult because they cannot offer collateral security say an insurance policy or title deed to land. Capital mobilized through personal savings is inadequate for any meaningful production. Loans taken from banks without security is very small and the undeveloped nature of stock exchange affect the capital base of private sector businesses in Ghana. The problem of inadequate financial base can be solved by the government providing funds for private sector initiative. The government should establish and encourage banks to give credit facilities to people who haye the skill but do not have adequate capital. The government can encourage banks to provide loans at reasonable terms to private sector enterprises to enable them acquire the machinery and raw materials they need for production.\n\n\
2. Foreign exchange problem: Privates sector enterprises face the difficulty of obtaining foreign exchange to import raw materials, machinery and spare parts. The persistent and continuous depreciation of the cedi has become a serious impediment to promoting private sector enterprises in Ghana. The depreciation of the cedi makes the import of machinery and raw materials so expensive and raises the production cost of locally manufactured products. As foreign exchange becomes difficult to obtain, the Ghanaian private businessman faces the problem of importing large quantities of raw material to produce his goods. To solve this problem, the government should institute a policy to subsidize foreign exchange rate for importation of raw materials and machinery. The agricultural sector must be revamped to produce raw materials locally to reduce the use of foreign exchange used to import raw materials, machinery and spare parts.\n\n\
3. High tax rates: High taxes serve as disincentive to private sector enterprises to produce more. High taxes on company profit reduce output and increase cost of production as well as price of the goods produced. High excise tax levied on goods produced by local private sector enterprises also increases prices of goods, reduce sales, and eventually reduce output. Indirect taxes like import duties are levied on imported raw materials and machinery. High import duties levied on imported raw materials and machinery reduce import of such raw materials and reduce the production of goods, which the raw materials are used to produce. To solve this problem, the government should grant tax holiday to new investors so that they can produce for about ten years before they start paying tax. The government should also lower taxes on locally produced goods so that private investors can compete favourably with cheap goods imported into the country. Import duties should be reduced to encourage importers to bring more raw materials and machinery and equipment needed to boost production by the private sector enterprises.\n\n\
4. Low taste for made-in-Ghana products: Ghanaians over depend on foreign goods, which they consider to be of high quality and long lasting to the detriment of locally produced goods. As a result many private sector enterprises may feel reluctant to engage in large-scale production since not many people will patronise the home produced goods. Many private sector enterprises have collapsed due to low patronage of locally made goods. Many Ghanaians have the feeling that the locally produced goods are of poor quality as compared with the imported goods. Ghanaians have developed insatiable desire for foreign goods and are prepared to pay any price for them. The solution to this problem is that the government must mount a campaign to induce Ghanaians to consume and patronize made-in-Ghana goods. This will show that they are patriotic and put Ghana first even in the choice of goods that they buy. To remove the erroneous impression that locally made goods are of poor quality, private sector enterprises should improve the quality of their goods to stand foreign competition.\n\n\
5. Trade liberalization: Trade liberalization encourages inflow of imports. Consequently, the local market may be flooded with cheap foreign products such as second hand cars and fridges, second hand clothing, soap, pomade, milk, matches etc. with the resultant environmental pollution. Trade liberalization has the effect of stifling private sector enterprises because foreign goods very often out- compete the locally made goods by way of mass production and lower prices. \n\nThe solution to this problem is that the government should ban specific imported goods such as matches, textiles, sandals, alcoholic drinks, plastic goods etc., which compete with similar goods produced locally. This measure will enable the private sector enterprises to be protected from unfair foreign competition and encourage them to increase production for the local market and also for export."

id: "question10b",
question: "10b. Suggest solutions to the problems identified in (a) above.",
options: "\
1. Inadequate skilled labour: Many private businessmen lack entrepreneurial skill because they lack training facilities, which will enable them improve on their production method, which will increase output. The educational system in Ghana emphasizes more on white-collar job to the neglect of technical and vocational training. The government should provide training facilities for highly skilled personnel. The training can take the form of workshops, seminars, management causes at the polytechnics, and universities to enable businessmen update their entrepreneurial skills and management practices.\n\n\
2. High cost of production: Private sector enterprises face high cost of production. Government charges indirect taxes, for example, import duties on raw materials like clinker or wheat or malt into the country for the production of goods like cement, and Guiness Malt. High taxes increase the cost of production of goods and reduce supply. This can increase the price of the commodity and reduce purchases. The government can reduce the high cost of production by reducing import duties, excise taxes and company profit tax. A reduction of these taxes will reduce the amount of foreign exchange private sector enterprises pay for raw materials imported. This will enable more raw materials to be purchased to increase the production of goods at low production cost. With low production cost the private sector enterprises can sell their goods at low prices.\n\n\
3. Bureaucracy: Businessmen go through cumbersome rules and procedures when registering their business. This results in a lot of man hours lost or wasted through long delays. Also because of the excessive use of formalities and strict adherence to rule and regulation there are delays in clearing in clearing goods from the harbour and this can breed corruption among high officials. The bureaucratic nature of the government institutions responsible for registering businesses must be relaxed so that procedures and formalities are streamlined to enable prospective businessmen register their businesses with minimum difficulty. Measures must be put in place to make businessmen clear their goods from the harbour on time to enable production to progress uninterrupted."
