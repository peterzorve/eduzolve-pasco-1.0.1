id: "question1aii",
question: "1aii. Explain why it is not advisable for a rhesus negative woman to marry a rhesus positive man.",
definition: "Reasons why it is not advisable for a rhesus negative woman to marry a rhesus positive man\
When a rhesus positive blood is introduced into a rhesus negative individual, production of\
antibodies against the factor is induced.\
During first pregnancy of a rhesus positive foetus only small quantities of antibodies are produced.\
Hence this may not cause a problem\
During subsequent pregnancies involving positive rhesus foetus enough antibodies would have been produced in the woman.\
If there is any leakage across the placenta and maternal blood mixes with foetal blood agglutination or clotting may occur leading to still born.",
