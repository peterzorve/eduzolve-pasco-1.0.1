passage: "Scientific inventions rarely come to us without their attendant risks. One such invention is electricity which is put to wide variety of uses. Electricity can be produced in many ways. Before hydroelectricity, for example, can be produced, a -41- has to be built across a fast flowing river. An artificial -42- is then formed and its water channeled through -43- specially designed and build to -44- electricity. Electricity is used to power a vast array of electronic -45- in homes and for reading at night. It is when there is power -46- that the value of electricity is really felt. Electrical -47- are not stable; Sometimes there are fluctuations and this can damage appliances. Amounts of electrical power are measured in -48- and flow through wires which are -49-. This is done to prevent shocks and -50-. Faulty wiring can cause fire outbreaks. Indeed, the benefits and risks associated with electricity make it a good servant but a master.",
