question:  "1a. Explain briefly sexual reproduction in Rhizopus.",
definition:  "Sexual reproduction in Rhizopus - By conjugation; \n It is usually between two strains of hyphae\nKnown as + and - plus and minus/ opposite mating types \nThe hyphae come in contact \nAnd produce small projections of their walls \nWhich develop into progametangia with several nuclei \nThe two progametangia enlarge \nEach progametangium develops a cross wall to divide into two parts; the gametangium and suspensor \nSubsequently the wall dissolves/breaks; and their contents/nuclei fuse to form a zygote \nThe zygote develops a thick wall to form a resistant zygospore \nThe zygospore germinates during favourable / damp / wet condition \n Into hyphae which bear sporangia.",
