definition:  "Independent Assortment of Genes; is the random selection of genes during meiosis to produce gametes, where the genes separate/segregate so that only one of a pair is found in any one gamete. In the dihybrid inheritance in heterozygote the pairs of alleles are found on different pairs of chromosome, Only four types of gametes are produced in approximately equal numbers.",

Gene O is recessive to both genes A and B which are dominant/co-dominant and possess antigen A and B in the red blood cells hence it is possible to have blood group A as AA (homozygous) or AO (heterozygous) and blood group B as BB or BO, Blood group O can only exist genotypically as OO and does not possess antigen A or B in the red blood cells or in the homozygous recessive state.",

question:  "5d. Describe briefly the process of dissecting a rabbit to expose its alimentary canal  [6 marks]",
definition:  "Dynamic Equilibrium; Nature does not encourage any population exceeding the carrying capacity of the habitat, living organisms play a role in the regulation of the abundance of organisms/population in the habitat. Interaction among various populations lead to competition which may result in the elimination of one species or its restriction to a non-competitive position, Plants sometimes compete by producing toxic chemicals that inhibit neighboring species, there also exists predator-prey relationship/association between animals all these forces act together to achieve dynamic equilibrium in the habitat.",
