question:  "1aii. Explain briefly the characteristics listed in (a)(i) above.",
definition:  "(a)(i)  Movement/Locomotion: Living things change position of the whole body/parts of the body from one place to another in search of food/shelter/mates etc. \n Excretion: This involves the removal/getting rid of waste products of cell metabolism, metabolic waste are poisonous if allowed to accumulate. \n Respiration: This is the breakdown of food substances by aerobic or anaerobic respiration to release energy need for all processes of life. \n Reproduction: This is the ability of living organisms to produce new individual of their own kind, this ensures the continuity of the species of organism. \n Irritability/Sensitivity/Response: Response or reaction of organism towards change in the environment, to ensure survival. \n Growth/Development: This is the irreversible increase in size and weight of an organism which leads to complexity and maturation. \n Nutrition/Feeding: The process involve in obtaining or manufacturing of food. It can be autotrophic or heterotrophic and utilizing it for growth and maintenance/life process.",

id: "question2b",
question:  "2b. Describe the digestion of boiled fish in the gut of humans",
definition:  "Boiled fish is a source of protein; which can be chewed and swallowed into the stomach. Digestion of proteins starts from the stomach; the stomach secretes gastric juice, containing pepsin, rennin and hydrochloric acid; pepsin in acidic medium acts on the boiled fish and converts it to peptide; peptides move into the duodenum where pancreatic juice is secreted; undigested protein is acted upon by trypsin in alkaline medium; peptides/peptones are formed; erepsin finally act on peptides/peptones in alkaline medium; this is finally converted to amino acids which is the end product of protein digestion.",
