question:  "4c. Explain three management functions. [6 marks]",

Planning is the managerial process of deciding in advance what is to be done and how it is to be done. The primary purpose of planning is to provide the guidelines for decision making. Planning involves setting objectives and showing how these objectives can be achieved. This involves selecting objectives and the strategies, policies, programmes and procedures for achieving the objectives, either for the organization as a whole or for a part of it. \nDecision-making is an integral part of management and occurs at all levels. Decision making can be \ndefined as making choices between future uncertain alternatives. That is, decision-making relates to the \nfuture and it is a choice between alternatives. \nDecision-making is a regular activity in everyday life. It is an activity, which pertains to all human and \nbusiness activities. Decision-making can be defined as that aspect of the management role that involves \nformulating considered judgement by analyzing facts and figures concerning a given situation with the\nvobjectives of the business in mind. Decision-makers are thus faced with many alternatives from which \nthey can make their choice. \nOrganizing may be defined as the division and grouping of activities of the enterprise and the allocation \nof duties, responsibilities and authority to carry them out. Organizing, therefore, involves the \nestablishment of a structure of tasks, which need to be performed to achieve the goals of the \norganization, grouping these tasks into jobs for an individual, creating groups of jobs within sections and \ndepartments, delegating authority to carry out the jobs, providing systems of information and \ncommunication, and coordinating activities within the organization.",

definition:  "\ni. Transfers: A transfer is a lateral movement within the same grade, from one job to another. They may lead to changes in duties and responsibilities, working conditions, etc. but not necessarily salary. \nii. Job posting: Job posting is another way of hiring people from within. In job posting, the organization publicizes job openings on bulletin boards, electronic media and similar outlets. One of the important advantages of this method is that it offers a chance to highly qualified applicants working within the company to look for growth opportunities within the company without looking for external opportunities. \niii. Employee referrals: Employee referral means using personal contacts to locate job opportunities. It is a recommendation from a current employee regarding. job applicant. The logic behind employee referral is that “it takes one to know one”. Employees working in the organization, in this case, are encouraged to recommend the names of their friends working in other organizations for a possible vacancy in the near future. In fact, this has become a popular way of recruiting people in the highly competitive IT industry now-a-days. Companies offer rewards also to employees whose recommendations are accepted – after the routine screening and examining process is over and job offers extended to the suggested candidates. As a goodwill gesture, companies also consider the names recommended by unions from time to time. \niv. Promotion: Promotion, on the other hand, involves movement of employees from a lower level position to a higher level position accompanied by (usually) changes in authority, duties, responsibilities, status and remuneration. Organizations generally prepare a central pool of persons from which vacancies can be filled in. such persons are usually posted to various departments, depending of internal requirements.",

instruction:  "8a. Explain each of the following principles of insurance:",
id: "question8ai",
question:  "8ai. contribution: [2 marks]",
definition:  "Contribution: Where separate covers are taken on one property with different insurance companies, the insured is entitled to get more than the loss, which is against the principle of indemnity. Under the principle of contribution, an insured who has taken one insurance policy with more than one insure  \ninsurance company. cannot be compensated by all of them separately in the event of an accident but rather they contribute to compensate him or restore him to the position in which he was before the accident occurred.

question:  "8aii. proximate cause; [2 marks]",
definition:  "Proximate cause: This principle says that if we insure against a certain eventualit\nrisk. we are entitled to compensation only if that eventuality is the immediate cause of the loss. This principle will therefore scrutinize and know the real or immediate cause of the loss or damage e.g. fire. The company must be satisfied that such an event forms part of the contract. Anything excluded from the contract, which turns out to be the proximate cause of an unfortunate event would not make the Insurance Company liable. Thus, a claim for death benefit under a personal accident policy would not be paid or entertained by the Insurance Company, if the assured died from an illness rather than by an accident, unless stated in the policy.",

Under Indemnity, when a person is being put back to his normal position after he has lost something or an item gets damaged, the Insurance company stands to benefit thereafter if any of the lost items are found. The word “subrogate” means “to step into the place of “. Thus, when the insurance company pays out a claim, it inherits the right of the person accepting settlement of the claim.",
},

{
id: "question8b",
question:  "8b. List and explain three tools of monetary control. [9 marks]",
definition:  "i.The Bank Rate:- The bank rate is the pivot of all interest rates because all interest rates depend on it. The interest rate charged by the commercial banks depends on the bank rate. The bank rate is the minimum rate of interest that the central bank charges on loans and advances granted to commercial banks and for re discounting bills of exchange. If the bank rate were high, all other rates of interest would be high and vice versa. . If the central bank wants to reduce money supply, it raises the bank rate so that commercial banks would be discouraged from borrowing more. If the bank rate is high, commercial banks will also raise the interest rate on loans they grant to their customers and thus deter them from borrowing. On the other hand if the central bank wants to increase the money supply, the bank rate would be reduced. \nii. Open Market Operation:- The most important tool that the central bank has for influencing the supply of money is the purchase and sale of government bonds and other securities in the open market and this is known as open market operation. To reduce the money supply, the central bank sells securities to the commercial banks and the public. Customers of the commercial banks who want to buy the securities will draw cheques on the commercial banks thereby reducing the reserves of the commercial banks. Through this process money moves from the public through the commercial banks to the central bank thereby reducing money in circulation. The central bank buys securities from the commercial banks and the public when it wants to increase money in circulation. This will increase the cash vault in commercial banks, and thus enables them grant loans and advances to the public and hence increase money supply. \niii. The Cash Ratio:- This is the minimum percentage of commercial banks deposit (cash reserve requirements) which is expected to be kept with the central bank. To reduce the supply of money the central bank raises the cash ratio, so that the commercial banks are legally obliged to deposit a huge percentage of their cash with the central bank. This will reduce the cash in the vault of commercial banks and thereby making them unable to grant more credit to the public. The reverse is true if the central bank wishes to increase money supply.",
