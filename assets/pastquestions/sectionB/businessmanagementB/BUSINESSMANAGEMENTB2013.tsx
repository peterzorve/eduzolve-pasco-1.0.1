The company had an\ninitial capital of sixty thousand Ghana cedis (GHC60,000). \nThe company floated shares and issued debentures in order to increase its capital. The company which\nwas formed in 2002, expanded very rapidly and by 2005, had a capital of one hundred and twenty\nthousand Ghana cedis (GH¢120,000). After five years s of\nits operation, the government complemented the company’s effort by providing the community with\nelectricity and pipe born water. This improved the standard of living of the people. As a result,\npopulation increased from four hundred to six hundred. \nGrand-Style Company took advantage of the new development and started fulfilling its corporate social\nresponsibility by tarring old roads, constructing new ones and awarding scholarship to the children in\nthe locality. \nAfter eight years of operation, Grand-Style started experiencing losses. New vehicles could no longer be\npurchased and broken down vehicles could not be serviced. In view of this, private spare parts dealers\nalso stopped selling on credit to the company.

question:  "3a. Outline three problems of trade among members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).",
definition:  "\ni. Language barriers: Different languages are spoken by different countries all over the world. It is very difficult for businessmen who speak different languages to communicate effectively and thus cannot do business with each other. It is also difficult for them to get an agent who can trade in both languages. \nii.The problem of operational currency: Differences in currencies is another obstacle to international trade. It is not every currency which is accepted in international trade. Thus if for instance Ghana wants to do business with U. K. (Britain) or America, she must first covert the cedis into pound sterling or dollars. \niii. Trade regulations: Trade regulations also hinder international trade. Such regulations include artificial barriers such as tariffs, quotas, prohibitions, etc. hinder international business. These measures sometimes frustrate exporters and importers and thus discourage them from increasing their trading activities. \niv.The financial problems: Exporters and importers lack financial assistance. Hence they cannot conduct effective market research to find the most suitable markets. Lack of adequate market information about foreign country could lead to failure in business. \nv.Cultural factors: The existence of different cultural practices creates a problem in international trade. Culture which is the way of life of people in a particular locality can affect the demand for a product. Their beliefs, likes and tastes determine the demand for a foreign product. It also makes advertising and distribution of foreign products difficult. \nvi.Different political and legal systems: The political atmosphere goes to a larger extent to determine the extensity to international trade. Where the political system is stable, many investors come in to invest. But where the system is unstable, less foreign investment is undertaken. Besides that, the legal system affects it in the sense that if the system is favourably exposed to the trade, it flourishes and vice versa.",

Increase in money supply: When there is an increase in money supply by printing more notes and coins without a corresponding increase in production too much money will be “chasing” few goods and hence leading to demand-pull inflation. \niii. Low productivity: Due to bottlenecks in production especially in West Africa economies, there is low productivity, leading to shortages of goods, hence inflation. That is aggregate demand will exceed aggregate supply leading to increase in prices, hence demand-pull inflation. \niv. Rapid population growth: Increase in population growth leads to excess demand over supply leading to increase in prices and hence inflation. The influx of people (refugees) from neighboring countries without a corresponding increase in food supply will lead to increase prices. \nv. Increase in government expenditure: In most cases investment in long-term projects such as construction of roads, leads to pumping of more money, so that in the short-run it may lead to excess liquidity and hence inflation.",
