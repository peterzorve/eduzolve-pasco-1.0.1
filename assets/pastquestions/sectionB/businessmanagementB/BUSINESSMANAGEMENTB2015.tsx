instruction:  "Read the following carefully and answer the questions that follow \nYAYA LIMITED \nYaya Limited was established by Yaw and Yaa with the printing of T-Shirts, receipt hooks, wedding and\nChristmas cards as their core business. \nEven though the directors of the company (Yaw and Yaa) had the opportunity to locate the business in\nthe city, they decided to locate it in their hometown, Kosania, a predominately rural community, with a\npopulation of not more than five thousand people. This was motivated by their desire to offer job\nopportunities to the large army of unemployed senior high school graduates in Kosania. \nYaw had never operated a business on his own but had worked in many factories. Yaa also had similar\nexperience in factory work. Both handled all sales and price related issues and used their experience in\nplant and equipment maintenance to service minor breakdowns. Major repairs were however\ncontracted to experts in the capital city, who have to travel long distances and often spent a number of\ndays on the repairs. This resulted in delayed production. \nThe patronage of the company’s products was low as the existence of the company and its products were\nlittle known in the stationery market. Prices of their products were fixed far above those of their\ncompetitors, because the company wanted to cream the market to pay for the initial cost of setting up\nthe business.\nFollowing the poor performance of the company’s product on the market, a market research was\nconducted and the finding was that customers were not ready to pay high prices for products that were\nnot too different in quality from similar products in the market.",

Absolute accountability: That is the manager who delegates should be held responsible for the results of the subordinates.

If the contract is not for a fixed period, the principal can at anytime revoke the agent’s authority and prevent him from acting on his behalf. This can be given in the form of notice. If the revocation is a breach of the principal’s contract with the agent, he will be liable to pay damages for loss of the agent’s commission.. \niii.

Efficiency ensures that resources are fully utilized without waste. \nv .Information flow:- Globalisation brings about increase in information flows between geographically remote locations, e.g., the advent of fibre optic communications, satellites, increased availability of telephony and internet has increased information flow. \nvi.

Difficulty of keeping good managers:- This is closely related to lack of managerial skills. Entrepreneurs lose talents because of low salaries and lack of opportunities for advancement. \niv. Lack of good overall planning/Failure to Plan:- Many entrepreneurs do not take cognisance of the importance of proper planning to the success of their firm.
