instruction:  "Read the following carefully and answer the questions that follow \nHOME TOUCH BANK LIMITED \nThe Home Touch Bank Limited was established in 2009 in Freetown, Sierra Leone. Its aim was to\nprovide a wide range of financial services to the newly established fishing and processing companies\nlocated in the coastal towns of Shenge and Tombo and other local fishing communities. Between 2010\nand 2014, the bank recorded high profits. Its reputation as a provider of variety of banking services\nsoared. Customers were particularly delighted with the conditions attached to overdraft and\nconcessionary loans in the purchase of fishing inputs. \nThe increase in demand for the bank’s products made the directors to introduce a decentralization\npolicy so that customers could be better served. Branch managers were allowed to take all decisions\nwithout referring to Head Office except on critical matters. Customers’ requests were promptly attended\nto. The average waiting time to serve customers was significantly shortened. As a result of quick\ndecision-making at the various branches, efficiency in service delivery was enhanced. \nIn 2015, the Board of Directors of the bank decided to take over most of the decisions made by branch\nmanagers. The branch managers were now to refer to Headquarters any loan request above ten\nthousand leones for approval. All concessionary loans were also to be approved by the Head Office. By\nthe end of 2015, the branch offices started experiencing drop in their customer level and staff turnover\nincrease. Competition increased sharply as a result of three new banks that entered the market.",
