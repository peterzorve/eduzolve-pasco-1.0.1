instruction:  "Read the following carefully and answer the questions that follow \nJOE WRIGHT PACKAGING LIMITED \nJoe Wright Packaging Limited was established in 2000 to produce cardboard boxes and paper wrappers.\nIt has a successful start with Mr. Frank Wusu as its managing director. For eight years, the company’s\nprofits rose steadily. \nIn line with its growth and expansion, the company added a sales department in 2009. Incentives in all\nforms were given to the sales staff to boost their morale, but these attracted sharp comments from\nemployees in the other departments who never benefitted from these incentive packages. Sales\nexpenses were forty-two percent higher than those of its competitors but sales volume was quite low. In\n2010, the company operated at breakeven as prices had to be lowered to retain the company’s market\nshare. In 2011, Joe Write Packaging Limited realized that it had entered a difficult period with a steady\ndecline in profits. \nAs analysis of the company’s situation reveal both external and internal constraints. For instance, for the\npast six months, there had been a constant stock pile of boxes and wrappers with limited promotional\nbudget. It was also discovered that many new firms had entered the market using penetration pricing\nstrategy. \nBusiness failure now stares right in the face of the company. Mr. Frank Wusu, the managing director, has\ntherefore arranged a meeting with the other managers to find solutions to the problems confronting the\ncompany.",

question:  "2b. State five reasons for the existence of small businesses in West Africa",
definition:  "\ni.  Small-scale business requires low capital especially in retail trade. As such, those who have little capital and want to set up a business, have no alternative but to use their limited capital to set-up small trading firms. \nii.  The small size of the market/Low income encourages consumers to buy in small units. West African markets are very small in size. This is because most of the people have low income as compared to the advanced countries. It therefore becomes necessary for most small-scale businesses to meet the demand for the scattered and few customers.\niii.  The Desire to be Independent: Most people will not want to work under anybody but will like to be their own boss. The only way to achieve this is to set-up their own firms so as to enable them to take decisions themselves and implement them immediately. \niv.  Low Level of Business Management/Expertise Required is Low: Establishment of small-scale business does not require large managerial skills to operate and this has encouraged West Africans wishing to set-up businesses to limit themselves to small-scale business. \nv.  Because of unemployment, petty trading is undertaken by many people. \nvi.  Because of low incomes, petty trading is undertaken to supplement regular income.",

question:  "4c. Explain the three channels of communication",
definition:  "Vertical communication: This refers to the flow of information from the top management downwards to the lowest level worker. That is from the superior to the workers and vice versa. There are two types of vertical flow of communication. These are the downward channel and upward channel \nHorizontal communication: It involves the lateral flow of information or messages from a manager to a manager of the same status or from an employee to another employee at the same post or from one department to the other. Horizontal communication thus occurs between managers or officers on the same level of command in different departments in an organization. \nDiagonal communication: Diagonal communication occurs when it involves inter departmental communication by people of different ranks. For example the managing director decides to communicate directly with the sales executive instead of communicating to him through the sales manager is an example of diagonal communication. It is therefore a method of communication where irrespective of the line of authority and command a manager of a department directly gives instructions and receives feedback from an officer in another department. It is also called cross communication.",

question:  "5c. State four factors that will influence the choice of a channel of distribution.",
definition:  "i. Producers’ Objective: The place objective of the firm must be considered before designing a channel of distribution for the product or service. \nii. Nature and Type of Product: The nature of the product may indicate its channel of distribution. For example, more perishable and fragile products like eggs need a much shorter channel because of its comparatively low price. However, more durable and expensive products like cars and furniture may be sold through a long channel of distribution. Also, highly technical products like electronic machines may attract direct sales to enable the manufacturer or his local representative provide technical advice on the usage and repair of machines. \niii. The Nature of the Market: If the market or final consumers of the product or service are concentrated in a particular geographical arca, it may not be marketable to use wholesalers, retailers, distributors, etc. since the final consumer could be reached with the least effort. \niv. Sales Volume: The volume of sales normally dictates the channel to be used because it is sometimes more economical to have middlemen to perform the distribution function if large quantities of the goods are produced and sold. Competition: At times the nature of the competition in the market may influence the selection of the channel of distribution. For example, in a situation where competition is very keen, producers may undertake direct sales especially in areas where competitors cannot afford to go. \nvi. The Availability of Channel Institutions: Channel institutions refer to intermediaries like wholesalers, retailers, distributors, salesmen, agents, etc. who are concerned with the distribution of goods and services to the final consumer. The choice of a channel depends on their availability. They must be available for a particular channel to be used. \nvii. Number of Potential Buyers: If the number is small, the producer would use shorter channel but if it is large, the producer uses all the middlemen, i.e., longer channels. \nviii. Financial Resources of the Producer: A producer who is financially capable can use his own salesmen or open his own retail outlets and therefore use shorter channel, while a producer without adequate capital uses a longer channel",

question:  "6b. roduct life cycle",
definition:  "Product life cycle Product life cycle is a series of stages that a product goes through in it’s market acceptance. Product life cycle traces the route through whch a product will pass from the time it is first introduced to the market to the time it will decline and either be replaced or fade away. After launching the new product, management wants the product to enjoy a long and happy life. When a new product is launched into the market it begins its life cycle. That is introduction stage, growth stage, maturity stage, saturation stage and the decline stage. The life cycle could also be divided into introduction, maturity and decline stage. The average life cycle of a product differs from the other depending on the demand, economic and competitive conditions on the market. Therefore, whereas a product may run through a life span of less than two years, another product may have more than ten years. A product will typically pass through five stages in its life.",
