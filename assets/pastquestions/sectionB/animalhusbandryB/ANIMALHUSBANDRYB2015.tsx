definition:  "Characteristics of eggs for hatching  \nColour (brown/white): The colour of the eggs should be brown or white.  \nClean eggs: The eggs should be clean devoid of any form of dirt.  \nSmooth-shelled eggs: The eggs for hatching should be smooth not rough.  \nNo cracks: The eggs for hatching should be devoid of any form of cracks.  \nOval shaped: The eggs for hatching should be oval in shape but not round.  \nSingle yolked: Single yolked eggs are ideal for hatching, double yolked egss should be avoided.  \n50-60g in weight: The ideal weight of eggs selected for hatching should be between 50-60g. Lesser weight egss should be discarded.  \nFertile: Eggs for hatching should be a fertile resulting from sexual activity between males and females not those laid by only females.  \nThick-shelled: Relatively thinned eggs shell should not be selected for hatching.",

question:  "1b. Explain six causes of low egg production in layers.",
definition:  "Causes of low egg production in layers  \nAge of bird: As a laying bird ages, the number of eggs laid reduce. Egg production is also relatively low in younger birds.  \nIncidence of disease: Diseases impair the physiological function of the birds hence poor egg production. Birds also use energy to fight the diseases they are suffering from.  \nPests Infestation: Birds become listless, stressful and pests can deprive birds of nutrients leading to low egg production. Pests may also transmit diseases.  \nLow quality of feed: When nutrient imbalance occurs, it leads to low egg production.  \nLow quantity of feed: Low quality feed may not provide sufficient energy for maintenance of body activities also underfeeding of birds also lead to low egg production.  \nInadequate supply of water: Egg contains a lot of water hence if water intake is inadequate, egg production will be low.  \nBreed of Birds: Certain breeds are naturally poor layers. If poor breeds are selected, low egg laid may occur.  \nPoor Housing: Poor ventilation, windy conditions, leakages etc. may dispose birds to disease and stress hence low egg production.  \nFrequent Disturbance: Frequent disturbances resulting from the removal of litter, removal of eggs, all creates noisy condition, and create pressure on laying birds resulting in low egg production of birds.  \nIntensity and Duration of light: High light intensity creates stress resulting in low. egg production. With extended light, birds consume more feed, put on fat and become broody resulting in low egg production.  \nBroodiness in Layers: Broody hens do not lay eggs due to hormonal imbalance.  \nOverfeeding: Birds which put on weight/ fat due to overfeeding by birds lead to low poor production.  \nMoulting of Birds: Period of moulting is a resting stage and this lead to low egg production.  \nCannibalism among birds: Birds that are pecked and put under stress and this lead to poor egg production.  \nStress: Other stressful conditions such as extremes of temperature, deworming, vaccination can cause egg production to drop drastically.",

question:  "3b. State four advantages and three disadvantages of the deep litter system of poultry keeping.",
definition:  "Advantages of deep litter system \nAnimals are protected from harsh weather conditions, predators etc \nPromotes efficiency in management. \nIt reduces loss of eggs. \nCan be used to produce fertile eggs for hatching. \nEnergy from food goes into production as birds do not roam about looking for food. \nWood shavings are cheap as bedding materials act as an insulator. \nRecord keeping is enhanced. \nInbreeding can be easily controlled. \nManagement of sick animals can be carried out easily. \nMore animals can be kept within a limited space. \nFeeding and feeds can be monitored.  \nDisadvantages of deep litter system. \nBirds have less freedom of movement hence less exercise than in the extensive system. Fowls do not get access to insects and greens to supplement their feed. \nInitial cost of housing is high/high financial outlay /or is capital intensive. \nFeeding cost is very high. \nPoultry vices are encouraged especially when overcrowded. \nEggs are prone to breakage when they are laid on the ground. \nEggs get dirty and contaminated if not collected early. \nLabour cost is very high. \nDiseases spread easily because animals are in close contact with each other. \nManure disposal is a major problem and may cause environmental pollution.",

Socially, livestock are slaughtered for merry making and religiously animals are slaughtered and the blood used for cleansing.  \nRuminant animals are slaughtered and used to throw party which help to unite families. A party is organized for family members and in the process disputes are settled.  \nStore of wealth. The number of animals a person has determines how the person has stored his wealth for future use.  \nGifts for visitors/ important personality.
