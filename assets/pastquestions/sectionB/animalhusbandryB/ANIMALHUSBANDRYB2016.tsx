Goat requirements for land spaces for grazing purposes is lower than that of cattle. \nGoats are cheaper to replace terms of mortality and in the value of loss. \nGoats can be reared easily all over the country because they are hardier and more resistance to most diseases than cattle. \nGoats have higher scavenging ability than cattle so they can fend for themselves on free range. \nGoats have shorter gestation period than cattle.",

An optimum/ suitable temperature is required for development of the embryo. \nRelative humidity: Relative humidity of 50-60% during the first 19 days and 75% during the last 2-3 days required to prevent dehydration of chicks in the hatcher. The right relative humidity prevents dehydration of the embryo. \nVentilation: Free movement of oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and water vapour through the shell is very essential for developing embryo. \nEgg positioning: Eggs are usually placed in the incubator with the large end facing up to facilitate the exchange of gases. \nEgg turning: The eggs are turned regularly in order to expose all sides to the required conditions and prevent the embryo from sticking to the shell.",
