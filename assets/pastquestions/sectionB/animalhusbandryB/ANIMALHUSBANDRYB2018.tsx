{
id: "question2d",
question:  "2d. Explain five factors which should be considered when formulating feed for farm animals.",
definition:  "Factors to be considered when formulating feed for farm animals \nPhysiological state of the animal  \nFeeds are formulated to meet the nutrient requirement of pregnant, lactating and laying animals. \nTypes of feedstuffs available: Use feedstuffs which are readily available and can serve as alternative to other feedstuffs in order to minimize cost of production. \nCost of feed ingredients: Different feed ingredients may contain some nutrients. However, they may have different prices. It is necessary to consider the cost so that feed ingredients of low prices may be bought to allow production of feed at very low cost/price. \nAge of the animals: Formulate feed that can provide nutrient requirement of different ages of animals. Generally younger animals require more protein than older ones \nPalatability of the feed: Formulate feed with feedstuffs which are acceptable to the animals on order to avoid wastage \nQuality of feed ingredients: Use feedstuffs which are clean and devoid of pathogens as well as having a high nutrient content in order to enhance growth and prevent diseases \nNutrient composition of ingredient: Use fees stuffs which contain high amount of nutrient \nBreed of animal: Use feed stuff that can provide high energy and protein based on the requirement of the breed. In poultry, layers require more calcium than non-layers Type/Purpose: Formulate feed to meet the nutrient requirement of the animal based on its function e.g. bullock cattle, dual purpose poultry etc \nHealth condition: The nutrient requirement varies with the health condition of farm animals. Sick animals tend to eat less; therefore, the nutrient level of their diet should be higher \nPresence of undesirable nutritional factors: Use ingredients without toxins to formulate feed for animals. Ingredients with toxins should be processed to enable the animal utilize the nutrient and avoid diseases. E.g., aflatoxin in groundnut. Toxic ingredients affected both palatability and smell of feed if added in excess amounts.",
