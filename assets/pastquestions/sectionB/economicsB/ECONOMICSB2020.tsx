In West Africa, taxes, both direct and indirect, contribute to over 80% of government revenue. Revenue collected enables the government to meet the cost of general administration, defense, and provision of social services. \nii. To protect infant industries – Infant or newly established industries are usually protected from the well-established ones in the developed countries through the imposition of heavy import duties. \niii. To check inflation – During a period of inflation, consumers’ purchasing power is reduced through heavier income taxes so as to check excess demand which causes prices to rise. \niv. To correct balance of payment problems – In a situation where a country suffers from a balance of payment difficulties due to excess imports over exports, the government taxes imported goods more heavily than exported ones so as to restrict imports and encourage more exports to reverse the situation.",
