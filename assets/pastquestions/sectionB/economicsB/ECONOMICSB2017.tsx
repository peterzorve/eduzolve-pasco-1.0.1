Possibility of substitute: If a commodity does not have an alternative within the same or a close price range, it is likely to be inelastic demand and vice-versa \nii. Habit: Habit is easy to form but very difficult to leave. The demand for developing a strong habit in a particular good is usually inelastic \niii. Consumer’s money income: The demand for the goods consumed  by higher-income earners is more elastic than that of low-income earners \niv. Cheaper commodities: The demand for cheap goods is mostly likely to be inelastic because consumer’s income is not noticeably affected by its price change \nv. Degree of necessity: When a commodity is considered very necessary, its demand is more likely to be inelastic \nvi. Degree of durability: The more durable and maintainable a commodity is the more elastic will its demand become",
