question:  "1ai. At what point does the perfect competition maximize profit?   Give a reason for your answer.      [4 marks]",
definition:  "The point where the perfect competitor maximizes profit is at point PQ1. This is  because price per unit (AR) exceeds the average cost of production.",

id: "question1aii",
question:  "1aii. What does the rectangle PMNC represent in the diagram?   [2 marks]",
definition:  "PMNC represents supernormal profit abnormal. This is because when output is Q2,  the cost per unit is NQ2, while the price per unit is MQ2. Supernormal profit per unit  is MN, total supernormal profit is PMNC",

id: "question1aiii",
question:  "1aiii. What happens to the rectangle PMNC in the long run?     Give a reason for your answer.      [4 marks]",
definition:  "In the long run the rectangle PMNC or supernormal profit will be totally eliminated.  This will happen because as the firm makes supernormal profit other firms will be  motivated to enter the market or industry.

question:  "1b. calculate the profit of the perfect competitor if price is $9.00, output is 80kg and cost per unit  is $5.00.",

question:  "2d. Draw the graph of the consumer’s marginal utility.     [7 marks]",
definition:  "The diagram shows that, with each successive unit of good consumed the marginal utility  diminish or reduce, until the marginal utility reaches zero and subsequently negative. This  means that, the consumer satisfaction reduces as he consumes more of a specific kind of good,  until he reaches at a point where he gets no satisfaction and end up with a negative effect of  consuming more of the goods.",
