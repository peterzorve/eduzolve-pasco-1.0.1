question:  "1c. Explain four reasons why child labour laws are difficult to enforce in Africa.",
definition:  "i. Lack of enforcement agencies: Enforcement agencies are non-existent and the few that exist are understaffed or ill equipped to carry out their mandate. \nii. Difficulty in identifying clear cases of child labour: In some instances, it is hard to define the laws to embrace all aspects of child labour. Thus some cases of child labour may be overlooked because the definition in the law is inadequate. \niii. Lack of welfare agencies: Charities and welfare agencies that can perform advocacy work against child labour are very few and in some countries unavailable. The lack of these agencies undermines any independent attempt to enforce such laws. \niv. Lack of political will to enforce the laws: Governments are unable to enforce the laws because it alienates them from the voting public since a clamp down on child labour also means reducing the sources of income for the majority of the voting public in poor communities.",
