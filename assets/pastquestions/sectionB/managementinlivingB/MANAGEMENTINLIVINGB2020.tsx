The contractions of \nthe uterus are not very strong at first and occur at long intervals. As the uterus contracts, it exerts a pull \non the cervix and causes it to dilate or open up. This first phase of labour lasts until the cervix is 2 or 3 \nfinger-breadths or 4 or 5cm dilated. At this stage, the mother is asked to relax during contractions.  \nii. The Second Stage of Labour:- This is the stage at which the mother-to-be has to work very hard. She \nhas to aid the passage of the child through the birth canal. The second stage is frequently announced by \nthe rupture of the foetal membrane or “bag of water”. In some cases, it could rupture at the end of the \nfirst stage. \nDuring the second stage, the mother gets the urge to push. This is caused by the pressure of the baby’s \nhead on the pelvis. The uterus continues to contract. With each contraction and pushing efforts of the \nmother, the baby’s head moves nearer the vulva opening, until the baby is born. This second phase \ncould last less than one hour but also varies with individuals.  \niii. The Third Stage of Labour:- The last stage involves the expulsion of the placenta. It is also known as after-birth. It breaks away from the wall of the uterus as the child is born. Further contraction of the uterus causes it to pass out through the vagina. The third stage is, therefore very short.",
