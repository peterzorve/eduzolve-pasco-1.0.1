question: "3b. Discuss four ways by which socialization is promoted in the Ghanaian society. The following are some of the ways socialization is promoted in the Ghanaian society:",
options: "\
1. Encouragement of children to participate in cultural programmes: Parents and teachers can encourage their children to take part in cultural programmes organized in schools during Speech Days, Open Days, etc. to inculcate in children the values of our culture e.g. naming ceremony, making libation, drumming and dancing, marriages, festivals etc. During naming ceremony lesson, for example, children can be encouraged to take certain roles like being the father and mother presenting their child for the naming ceremony. By taking these adult roles the children are made to appreciate the value of our culture.\n\n\
2. Provision of moral education to younger generation: Parents have the responsibility to give their children good character training and moral upbringing. It is the duty of parents to teach the child the dos and don’ts of the society so that the moral values of the child can be an example to other children. Some examples of moral values parents have to teach their children include being honest and trustworthy, being patient, being courageous and never giving up. To achieve a good character and moral education of the child, parents must keep constant watch over their children so as to ensure that the children grow up to socially acceptable standards and can differentiate between good and bad.\n\n\
3. Helping the young ones to develop good behavior patterns: Socialization beings at home where the parents teach their children how to dress, talk to elders, not hurting others and also standing up for those who can’t stand up for themselves and being honest with others. These behavior patterns will enable the child to fit into the society and be able to ward off any negative behavior influences on him/her.\n\n\
4. Provision of family life education in schools: The schools can organize family life education programmes so that the youth will know that they are physically able to engage in sexual activity and produce children but lack the experience and knowledge of mature adult. Therefore the youth can be informed about sexual and reproductive health issues, such as the consequences of teenage pregnancy (criminal abortions, school dropouts, single parenthood), STDs including HIV/AIDS, thereby minimizing their effects on the youth in particular and the society.\n\n\
5. Organizing of cultural festivals in the communities and schools: Most communities organize cultural festivals, and it is the duty of parents to allow their children to witness such festivals since they will help them understand their organization and know their cultural value to the society. Schools can encourage teachers teaching social studies to organize cultural festivals whereby students take active part in their organization so that they can describe them better in examination. For example, students can know the purposes for celebrating the various cultural festivals. The people of Osu, for example, celebrate the “Homowo” festival which means hooting at hunger.\n\n\
6. Production and staging of patriotic songs to show virtues and values of the society: The mass media especially the radio and television can play patriotic songs such as “Yen ara y’asease ni”. These songs can be translated into the languages of the ethnic groups and played every morning to remind all Ghanaians that we all belong to one nation. Patriotic songs can be taught at schools and sung at morning assembly, Republic Day and Independence Day celebrations.\n\n\
7. Broadcasting of dramatic performances that show virtues and values of the society: Socialization can be promoted by using the television and radio to broadcast or show the national sanitation week organized in towns and villages to encourage people to maintain clean environment. The television can also be used to encourage people to use Ghanaian local textile prints with local names such as “Gye Nyame”, “Sankofa” and avoid using the Chinese or Holland textile prints. Social values such as being respectful and courteous in our interactions and volunteering time and skills in the community (e.g. communal labour, voluntary work) are necessary to promote socialization in the Ghanaian society.\n\n\
8. Organization of variety of programmes for youth development: The National Sports Council for example, organizes Milo Games for the youth in Second and First Circle Institutions to -unearth talents in table tennis, football, volley ball, sports etc. Talents unearth in these games find their way into national teams.\n\n\
9. Provision of opportunities for occupational training of the youth: The youth are exposed to varieties of occupations which their parents do e.g. baking, sewing, basketry, farming, fishing, carpentry etc. out of which he/she selects one and engages in it to earn a living. Children learn from their parents the occupations they do: If a mother is a baker the children assist their mother in her bakery business and they easily acquire the rudiments of baking from home. In the secondary school and the polytechnic a girl who wants to undertake baking as her occupation can perfect it at this level. The same applies to a child whose father is a carpenter. He will learn the rudiments of the carpentry at home and can perfect it when he enters a technical institute.\n\n\
10. Provision of opportunities for domestic training of the youth: The home provides the best place for domestic training of the youth. The child copies anything he/she sees his or her parents or siblings do. It is the home the youth learns his first lessons in obedience, politeness, neatness and generosity, honesty etc. In the home the youth are exposed to household activities such as cooking, washing, sweeping and cleaning."

question: "4. Outline five measures that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) can take to control hazards created by mining activities in Ghana.",
definition: "The following are some of the measures Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) can take to control hazards created by mining activities in Ghana.",
options: "\
1. Public education on the dangers/hazards associated with mining activities: The EPA can organize public education in schools, churches, mosques, and also by using the media (both print and electronic), etc. The television can show the destruction caused by illegal mining activities in the areas they operate and educate Ghanaians on the usefulness of the environment to us and the hazards that follow when there is destruction. Many Ghanaian chiefs, and those who own land give out huge and vast land to foreigners to mine for gold thus causing pollution in our water bodies and the degradation of the forest and cocoa farms. The Agency can educate the people to protect their lands against illegal mining and ensure that those who mine in their environment have genuine permit to do so.\n\n\
2. Strict application of environmental laws including sanctions and imposition of penalties: The EPA can be empowered to make and enforce all laws concerning the environment. The Agency must have the powers to sue those who mine without proper documentation and the machines of illegal miners ceased.\n\n\
3. Liaising with the minerals commission to make mining companies comply with environmental laws: Many mining companies operate illegally either their licenses have expired or have violated mining rules and have destroyed properties of farmers. The EPA can liaise with the minerals commission to ensure that mining companies which pollute the water bodies make surface mining which degrade the environment are sanctioned and their license revoked or made to cease operation.\n\n\
4. Avoiding water pollution and mining related diseases: The EPA can ensure that chemicals such as cyanide and mercury are carefully used to avoid water pollution and mining related prices. Unscientific methods of mining, known as “galamsey” often involves indiscriminate digging of trenches which collect water creating breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Settlements around such areas experience malaria and other waterborne diseases. The EPA should ensure that miners who operate illegally are brought under one umbrella and their operations supervised.\n\n\
5. Compelling the mining companies to undertake afforestation projects at mining sites/ Reclamation of the land: The EPA can ensure that mining companies replant trees in abandoned mining areas and also replace trees that are cut down in order to make the area a forest. Where trenches are created as a result of mining activities such areas can be reclaimed by using such areas as land fill sites.\n\n\
6. Resettlement of people displaced by mining activities: The EPA can ensure that mining companies undertake the social responsibility in the locality with seriousness. Mining companies should resettle people displaced by mining activities to make them free from sound and air pollution.\n\n\
7. The EPA can compel the mining companies to provide adequate social amenities such as schools, hospitals, and clinics as well as ventilated houses in the mining communities. The Ashanti Gold Fields, for example, has provided the people of Obuasi with a Sports Stadium, and other social amenities.\n\n\
8. Conducting research to improve on mining activities: The EPA can be given the necessary equipment, vehicles, and funds to enable them research into ways of solving environmental problems that come along with mining activities particularly illegal mining popularly called galamsey. The EPA can come out with new methods of mining that will reduce environmental hazards and help regain the land after mining.\n\n\
9. Regularization of illegal mining and galamsey operations: It is the responsibility of the EPA to ensure that all illegal mining and galamsey operations are brought under one umbrella so that their activities can be co-ordinated and controlled. People conducting illegal mining can be prosecuted and face the necessary punishment. This measure can help check the activities of illegal mining and ensure that they regularize their papers or their mining concessions before they start operation.\n\n\
10. Conducting periodic inspection of mining facilities: The EPA help in controlling hazards created by mining activities in the country when their men and the police visit the communities regularly to check the activities of mining facilities and sanction those who violate their rules. If the EPA conducts periodic checks of mining facilities this will put fear in them and ensure that they conduct their operations properly."

question: "9b. Explain four measures that are adopted to develop human resource in Ghana.",
options: "\
1. Provision of job opportunities: The human resource in Ghana can be developed if the government and the private sectors create job opportunities for the unemployed youth. For example, the government can establish entrepreneurial training centres to assist job seekers to learn trades like carpentry, bead making, batik making, tie and dye, hair dressing, computing, gari processing, soap making etc. so that after graduation they can establish their own businesses.\n\n\
2. Provision of necessary tools and equipment for workers: Employers are expected to put in place the right type of tools and equipment to enable the worker using them to perform better and produce more goods. If the tools or machines are old and are not regularly serviced this means that constant breakdown of the tools or machines can reduce labour productivity. New tools and modern machines can be purchased for workers to use to increase production.\n\n\
3. Provision of programmes for motivating workers: Workers should be motivated to put up their best at work places. Workers can be given adequate salaries, wages and allowances so as to avoid the situation where they leave their work places to do other jobs for additional income. This will control pilfering, embezzlement, falsification of accounts and other malpractice. Workers can enjoy loan facilities to enable them purchase their own means of transport, build houses, pay for their children’s education and have free health services for themselves and their families and also enjoy subsidised canteen services. Hard working workers can be rewarded with promotions and sponsored for further training.\n\n\
4. Provision of technical and vocational education: The government can establish more technical and vocational institutions in the district capitals so that youth from the rural areas can acquire such education from them. The polytechnics as well as technical and vocational. departments of Senior High Schools can be adequately resourced so that they can teach students who can be employable after their education. Students can be taught subjects like building, technology, masonry, carpentry, computer science, hair dressing, batik making, sewing, tire and dye, clothing and textile, ceramics etc. These trades can make the youth from these institutions set up their own businesses with minimum assistance.\n\n\
5. Holding of conferences, seminars and workshops: Human resources can be developed when institutions and organizations organize conferences, seminars and workshops for their workers to increase their work performance and also acquire new methods of new doing things in their institutions to increase their output. These institutional training programmes are necessary to update the skills of workers and management. It has been proved that all the countries, which have developed, have highly skilled human resources."

question: "10a. With the aid of a diagram, explain the concept of vicious cycle of population growth.",
definition: "Vicious cycle of population growth means that with high population growth rate the result is high dependency burden as the rise of the young expands rapidly. This results in low savings and low investment for the individual and the government as a whole. Low investment leads to low economic growth, which leads to low standard of living among the people. The low standard of living finally leads to high population growth. High Population growth Fig.4:",

question: "10b. Outline four measures that can be adopted to break the vicious cycle of population growth in Ghana.",
definition: "The Vicious Cycle of Population Growth Some of the measures to break the vicious cycle of population growth are as follows:",
options: "\
1. Sex education in schools:- To control population growth, the government should include the teaching of sex education in the school programme. If sex education is widely taught in our schools it would help to prevent unwanted pregnancies and reduce population growth. There should be very effective information, education, and communication programmes on family life education especially in our educational institutions.\n\n\
2. Public Education on the effect of rapid population growth: Public education can be done through the mass media, both electronic and print, television, radio and newspapers, churches, mosques etc. for people to appreciate the need to curtail the rate at which they give birth to children. People should be made to understand more fully the problems associated with unprotected sex and also having large families. Family Planning activities must be intensified through existing institutions and agencies such as the non formal education programmes, National Council on Women and Development etc.\n\n\
3. Use of Efficient family planning methods: People have to be educated and encouraged to use various birth control methods such as contraceptives (the pill, loop, the coil and the condom). Birth control could also be carried out by the Billings ovulation method which is a more natural process. Operations such as vasectomy and tubal legation will also limit the number of children that people produce. The government should ensure that family planning clinics, health centres and hospitals have these family planning contraceptives readily available and sold at very moderate prices to enable people patronise them.\n\n\
4. Undertaking of mass literacy programmes/non formal education: Many people in the rural areas are illiterate and to make them aware of the dangers of population growth and the benefits of birth control, the government should increase its literacy campaign to allow a greater number of people in both rural and urban areas to avail themselves of the information on birth control. For example, the family planning nurses and doctors at the Family Planning clinics, health centres and hospitals can advise young married couples and young people about the dangers of high population growth. The Information Service vans can go to the rural areas and educate people about the dangers of teenage pregnancy and the need to give birth to fewer children and space the birth of their children.\n\n\
5. Implementation of policy against early marriage: The minimum age at which people could marry could be fixed by law, thereby making people marry at a later age when there would be less chance of giving birth to many children. This is specially important for women whose fertility ends at around 45 years of age.\n\n\
6. Incentives for couples with small family size: The government may give incentives to families with few children. For example, families with few children should be given tax relief. The government can restrict free or subsidised maternal and child care services to those with few children to encourage young married couples to give birth to fewer children.\n\n\
7. Promotion of education among girls: The promotion of female education or girl-child education is meant to encourage many females to attend schools. It is assumed that when more girls are made to go to school, they would not marry at an early age. In addition, education will make people to be aware of the importance of a small family size.\n\n\
8. Execution of poverty alleviation schemes/Provision of employment: The high dependence of age. In addition, education will make people to be women on their male counterparts has also been recognised to be partially responsible for the high birth rate in the country. The government is therefore putting in place measures to ensure that women play an active role in the socio-economic development of the country. The National Council on Women and Development together with other government agencies are making efforts to provide trading programmes in bead making, sewing, weaving, cake making etc. for women to enable them acquire employment or set up their own businesses.\n\n\
9. Enforcement of immigration laws; Strict immigration measures such as making entry requirements very stringent and policing the borders very tight help to curb illegal entry will also help reduce the population growth rate."
