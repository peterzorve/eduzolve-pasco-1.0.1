question: "2b. Highlight four reasons why individuals get married in Ghanaian society. [16 marks]",
definition: "The following are some of the reasons why individuals get married:",
options: "\
1. Legitimate avenue for Sexual satisfaction: Marriage provides a legitimate avenue for sexual satisfaction. Sexual intercourse is an. important aspect in marriage because it is through sexual intercourse that children are born into the family. It is important because sex brings about continuity in lines of generations. Marriage also ensures that legitimate children are born to the couple.\n\n\
2. Procreation/Child-bearing: Since marriage is an important social institution it is a moral obligation for every normal person to marry and bear children so that the society does not go extinct. As the older people die off young ones must replace them to ensure continuity of the human race, to perpetuate the name of their parents and the family at large.\n\n\
3. Companionship: Marriage provides the avenue for people to fill the void of loneliness. This is because marriage prevents people from becoming lonely and enables a man and a woman to keep each other in company and share their lives and ideas together. Through this companionship the couples are able to discuss private or pertinent and personal issues to ease their psychic.\n\n\
4. To become responsible - payment of rents, school fees etc.: Marriage offers support to the couples. In the urban centres where both the man and woman are all working outside the home, they both contribute to the family budget. The man assists the woman in payment of rents, light and water bill. In addition, married couples must ensure better education for their children by paying their school fees and supplying them with textbooks, exercise books, pencils etc. Married couple enters into marriage to ensure that their sick children are given proper medical care. In the urban areas, where both the man and the woman are all working outside the home, they both contribute to the family budget. There is therefore a reciprocal support for each partner.\n\n\
5. Provision of support to one another- financial, moral and emotional: Marriage ensures that the house is well kept and children live a better life. As a result the husband is required to provide housekeeping money for the wife; while the woman also ensures that she prepares food for the family. In the rural areas the man goes out to work in the field and the woman concerns herself in the keeping of the home and caring for the children. Individuals get married so that they can also ensure that their children learn moral values of the society. Children are expected to be honest, speak well and show respect to their elders as well as learn the norms and beliefs of the society. Married couples should show love for themselves and be each others keeper in times of stress and ill health. In marriage, each considers the problems of the other as his or her own. They work towards a common goal and share the burden and failures together.\n\n\
6. Adult status and Social acceptance/To gain societal respect and prestige: Marriage provides adult status and social acceptance to the couple. Anybody particularly in Ghanaian society who is not married is recognised as immature and therefore would not be assigned adult responsibility. Such a person usually does not take part in adult functions. In the northern region of Ghana, the Bassare, for example, such people are buried in longitudinal graves when they die while the married are buried in round graves with a mound made on the surface. Parents and the entire society recognise and feel happy that their young ones have married since they gain societal respect and prestige.\n\n\
7. Provision of security and protection to each other: Marriage ensures that the man is the head of the family and he thus makes sure that members of his family are duly protected physically and spiritually. The husband has to ensure that the wife and children have a better accommodation so that they will have a piece of mind to carry on their daily activities. The father has to protect the children from bullies and peer influences like stealing, fighting etc that can mar the future of the children. The father must also protect the family from spiritual attacks by ensuring that they go to church and mosques and pray constantly for Gods protection against evil attacks.\n\n\
8. To unite families and ethnic. groups: Marriage binds two families and ethnic groups and also fosters unity among members associated with the marriage. Heads of the families of a married couple act as arbitrators to settle not only marital problems but also family misunderstanding. Married couple may continue to members. receive financial and other support from their immediate family and extended family. Family members may also continue to offer various types of assistance in the form of food, money, advice etc. Marriage which involves couples from the Ewe and Akan tribes bring the two ethnic groups together. Such infer-tribal marriage promotes ethnic unity in the country."

question: "3a. Explain four causes of desertification in Ghana. [8 marks]",
definition: "Desertification is the destruction of the biological potential of the land which leads to the destruction of the vegetation and makes the land infertile. It is not the expansion of desert. Desertification an existing is therefore gradual drying up of once productive land. The following are some of the causes of desertification:",
options: "\
1. Over-cultivation or Over-cropping Leading to Soil Infertility One method by which desertification is brought about is over cultivation or over-cropping of large tracts of farm land. Where large tracts of land have been farmed for several years or several crops have been cultivated on large tracts of land without alternating the crop the soil fertility reduces through the removal of nutrients by the crops. The soil structure is also often damaged through improper mechanisation practices. The land surface is often exposed to erosion leading lo soil organic depletion. The cause of over-cultivation may normally be due to the result of the land tenure system which restricts the farmer to a particular farming area for a long time.\n\n\
2. Poor Irrigation Management/Poor Drainage: Poor irrigation management can also br1ng about desertification. That is improperly designed irrigated lands leads to desertification. Initially the soil becomes water-logged due to poor drainage. At high temperature during the dry season, the water evaporates and the soil water becomes saltier. The salts are then deposited as white crust on the soil surface. This leads to the final process of salinisation and alkalinization ,which deprive the land of vegetation. The land thus becomes bare and erosion sets in.\n\n\
2. Deforestation: Deforestation is another factor that brings about desertification. This is the felling of trees for agricultural practices like lumbering, charcoal burning and farming. When trees are removed the land surface becomes bare and the exposed land is baked hard by 1he sun resulting in loss of organic matter. The unprotected land surface is then worked on by rain causing erosion.\n\n\
4. Bush Fires/Bush Burning: Bush fires another major cause of desertification particularly in Ghana is bush burning due to poor farming practices. The farmer clears the land for cultivation and sets fire to the weeds. This fire may go beyond his farm boundary when uncontrolled with fire belts and cause lot of harm to other farms in the arca. When the vegetation is thus burnt evaporation and transpiration that induce rainfall is rendered negative. The water factor therefore brings about acidity resulting in soil infertility. Repeated burning of the land destroys the soil organisms and nutrients. The land becomes bare and deprived of vegetation cover.\n\n\
5. Wrong application of agro-chemicals like fertilizer: Weedicides and pesticides do a lot of harm to the land by destroying the soil organisms and nutrients. in the soil. The soil structure is thus destroyed and the surface is worked on by wind and rain causing erosion.\n\n\
6. Overgrazing by animals: Another reason for desertification is overgrazing which resul1s from high livestock density on range land. Since the vegetative cover serves as the main food requirement there is a degradation of the vegetation. The soil compaction is also trampled on by the livestock. As the vegetation is removed the soil is blown away and rain water runs off instead of into the soil resulting in soil erosion by wind and water.\n\n\
7. Long periods of drought/ Long dry season: Climatic changes could affect the survival of species. These climatic changes can result in less rainfall or persistent absence of rainfall which cannot support the growth and survival of trees. The long dry season resulling from less rainfall can therefore lead to desertification.\n\n\
8. Bad mining methods by galamsey operators: Ghanaians degrade the environment by using unscientific methods popularly known as the 'galamsey'. This type of mining often involves indiscriminate digging of trenches with in most of them untilled after mining. This method of mining destroys vegetation and farmlands and contributes to serious environmental problems in the country\n\n\
9. Erosion: Erosion is the gradual wearing of the top soil by water and wind. Desertification increases the chances of all types of erosion -sheet, gully, etc. which work against the land. Sheet erosion is caused when wind carries away the top layers of the soil, while gully erosion, on its part, takes place when both wind and rain widen and deepen the land thereby spoiling a once productive land."

id: "question3b",
question: "3b. Outline four ways of minimizing desertification in your country. [12 marks] SECTION B GOVERNANCE, POLITICS AND STABILITY",
definition: "The solutions to desertification include the following:",
options: "\
1. Enforcement of environmental protection laws: The existing laws on bush burning, illegal mining, improper application of agro-chemical etc. must be enforced to deter people who indiscriminately burn bushes or undertake bad mining methods like galamsey operators. Such people should be prosecuted and fined or imprisoned to serve as deterrent to other people. With illegal mining the equipment used for mining should be confiscated and the culprits prosecuted.\n\n\
2. Proper application of agro chemicals: Extension officers should visit farmers and teach them the proper way of applying agro chemicals on their crops so that they do not destroy the nutrients in the soil and cause erosion. The extension officers should encourage the farmers to apply local manure like cow dung, poultry droppings, etc. on their crops\n\n\
3. Public Education: The mass media should be used to educate farmers to know the need to grow and protect trees. School children and adults must be educated on the need to plant more trees and protect the trees to grow. This should be a continuous process so that our dwindling forest can be sustained, since when the last tree dies mankind will also be extinct.\n\n\
4. Controlling overgrazing: Farmers must be encouraged to alternative food for farm animals. Farmers can dry the grass that the animals eat a lot so that they can eat in doors. Animal fodder can also be produced on large scale and kept by farmers so that cattle, goats and sheep can feed in doors. Where the animals are to eat outside there should be a guide to ensure that the animals do not feed at the same place all the time.\n\n\
5. Re-afforestation: This refers to planting trees on bare land where there were once trees. The Forestry Department should raise seedlings in nursery farms and supply them to identifiable groups like farmers, schools, Municipal and Districts Assemblies to transplant the young ones. Individual and organizations can also be encouraged to nurse trees and nurture them. District Assemblies may also award prizes to institutions and organizations for undertaking tree planting on Environment Day.\n\n\
6. Afforestation: With afforestation trees are grown on non-forest land to begin vegetation. The leaves that fall from the trees make the soil fertile again. The yearly tree planting exercise undertaken by schools should be made compulsory for all schools in the country. Students should also be encouraged to plant trees in their locality every year as a way of ensuring that the land is not left bear.\n\n\
7. Controlling bush fires: Fire belts must be created between farms to check the spread of bush fires. Another measure to control bush fire is to burn cleared vegetation during the early part of the dry season. During this period the surrounding vegetation contains some amount of water, which prevents it from burning easily. Modern fire-fighting equipment can also be used to put out bush fires promptly. Farmers must also contract fire experts in the locality to assist in setting fire to cultivated lands.\n\n\
8. Preserving forest by instituting forest reserves and scared grooves: Creating forest reserves can help to conserve the physical environment. The District assemblies should encourage the local people to create forest reserve sites in their communities and also ensure the preservation and creation of new fetish/sacred grooves. Forest guards must be well equipped to protect the forest from animal poachers, illegal sawing and from the local people from encroaching on forest reserves for faring purposes and also for illegal mining activities."

{
id: "question4b",
question: "4b. Discuss four effects of lack of socialization on the society. [16 marks]",
definition: "The following are some of the effects of lack of socialization on the society",
options: "\
1. Deviant behaviour proliferates society e.g. substance abuse, prostitution ete. When the children are not fully integrated into the society they will be exposed to various vices such as drug abuse etc. The exposure of the youth to drugs either at school or home has serious consequences for himself and the society. The use of drugs to study or get more energy has made many teenagers to become drug dependent. The use of drugs by the youth has made them to resort to stealing, or drug pushing or peddling, which has landed many them in jail. It is also not uncommon to find many youth becoming drug addicts and resorting to rape and drunkenness. Many youth have become insane and even died through excessive use of drugs.\n\n\
2. There will be problem of developing personalities e.g. loss of self respect, low achievers etc.: Frequent discouragement from family members, peers and elders do not make an individual to develop his capabilities or personality. If the individual is discouraged, fear builds up in him and this means that he cannot take independent decision or action for fear that he may be blamed for the decision or action taken. Again, if the individual does not get love and attention from his parents, siblings, teachers and 'friends this can lower his morale or lower his or her self image or loose self respect. A child who is not loved by his parents at home develops fear and becomes timid. It there 1s no one to strengthen or help the child he losses self-confidence and cannot develop his potentialities or capabilities which can make him a responsible person in the society.\n\n\
3. There will be frustration and deprivation because children will not be provided for in the society leading to streetism, child labour etc. When children lack financial support which will enable their parents provide their basic needs like clothing, food, shelter, etc. they seek these needs from their friends who are on the streets. Such children sleep at the lorry parks, join bad friends and are easily employed by chop bar keepers to pound their fufu and others are employed to do menial jobs. Such children are usually exploited and physically abused.\n\n\
4. There will be breakdown of public / social morality e.g. indecent dressing, foul language, corruption: When the social morality of the people breaks down children will not have any standard by which they can measure their behaviour with and may take it that the current behaviour of their peers are the proper way of life for them. This explains why these days many youth and elderly people use indecent language on the airways to the extent that anybody can use foul language against the President of the country as if he were his equal. Many youth think that if you dress indecently that means that you are a 'guy' or a modern person.\n\n\
5. Resources are often channelled into maintaining law and order. Lack of socialization can make the youth not respect the laws of the country. This means that the government will have to use its resources in the form police and vehicles and other logistics to maintain law and order at places where disturbances have taken place. As a result of such disturbances the government will have to use more resources to maintain prisons since law breakers will be imprisoned, care for the mentally challenged people. The end result is that as more productive people who are the youth are sent to prison for breaking law and order the productivity of the country will fall and this will bring about low development.\n\n\
6. Loss of cultural identity: The influence of foreign culture or life styles on the Ghanaian society has made the youth to be easily influenced by other cultures. Many adolescent girls look down on puberty rites as old fashioned and would not take part. Again, the family finds it difficult in correcting the dressing of their children because the adolescents regard their dressing as modern and that of their parents as out of fashion. As a result the youth has no respect for our culture\n\n\
6. Break down of extended family system: The extended family system used to protect the child in the family from bad company and foreign habits. With the influence of modernization the extended family system has broken down thereby making it difficult to carry on its moral role in shaping the character of child. The complementary role of the extended family in helping the socialization process of the child is lost. Many children now stay with their family in the urban centre thereby making it difficult for the extended family to effectively perform its complementary role of controlling the life of the child. The uncles, aunties, cousins etc. are not available in the urban centres to assist the family to give a helping hand in ensuring that the child acquires values like honesty, respect for the aged, hard work, respect for authority etc.\n\n\
7. Low productivity as result of poor work ethics: The aim of every business concern is to increase output to make profit. If workers fail to work harder and exhibit positive behaviours at work there will be low productivity. Some of these negatives attitudes that affect their productivity include lateness, laziness, irregularity etc. For example, if workers do not go to work on time, but use working hours for their personal business and close from work earlier than the normal time, workers cannot achieve their output target and consequently productivity will reduce.\n\n\
8. There will be problem of cultural preservation i.e. many of our traditional practices will be lost. Lack of socialization has diminished the respect that we have for our sacred grooves and river_. In the olden days people respect the sacred grooves and our rivers and have prohibited days for not going to farm or draw water from the river. These days people don't respect these traditional practices. Children born in the urban centres whose parents come from rural areas, hardly take part in puberty rites or get themselves involved in traditional festival. They regard them as barbaric and unchristian."

},


{
id: "question5b",
question: "5b. Explain four consequences that arise as a result of suspending the constitution of a nation. [16 marks]",
options: "\
1. Human rights violation: One of the consequences that is likely to occur if constitutional rule breaks down is the infringement on fundamental human rights. Under constitutional rule, there is the maximum respect for human rights. People are punished for infringing upon the rights of others. Some of the rights under the 1992 Ghana Constitution are: freedom of speech and expression, freedom of thought, conscience and belief, freedom of association, movement, assembly etc. However when constitutional rule breaks down these human rights may be abused or violated since there would be no respect for human rights. When people easily infringe upon the rights of other people and are not punished for that they will not have respect for human rights and responsibilities will not be executed as well by citizens.\n\n\
2. Dictatorship: When constitutional rule breaks down this leads to d1ctatorship or autocratic rule or leadership. There is no laid down rules to bring free and fair governance of the country hence the government tends to take the law into its hands and does what pleases it. The government tends to give orders and instructions any how. The government does not care about the views of the people and hence dictates to them they should do. Again, when constitutional rule breaks down, the Judiciary will be controlled by the executive. The executive would interfere in the affairs of the Judiciary and when this happens it will prevent the judiciary from checking the executive when they go wrong. The press may also be dictated to by the executive. This will prevent the press from pointing out the mistakes of the government.\n\n\
3. There would be lawlessness: When constitution rule breaks down there would be an increase in the number of people with deviant behaviour taking the law into their hands to harass people. If social deviants are not given the appropriate punishment they deserve for their actions according to the constitution, this will lead an increase in social vices like armed robbery, drug addiction, prostitution, gangsterism, traffic offences, stealing etc.\n\n\
4. Change of government becomes difficult: Another consequence likely to occur if constitutional rule breaks down is that change of government becomes violent which may result in assassinations, coup d’états, foreign interventions etc. For example, coup plotters may make several attempts to overthrow the ruling government and this can bring about chaos and confusion in the country as this may lead to loss of live and property.\n\n\
5. A halt in development projects: Break down in constitutional rule may lead to a halt in development projects undertaken by the previous government. The new government may have its own political agenda and not follow policies and programmes of the previous government. As a result the developments projects like roads, bridges, school buildings etc. of the previous government may be stopped. Again, owing to the fact that constitution has broken down people may evade paying taxes needed by the government to undertake development projects like roads, schools, hospitals, water and electricity etc.\n\n\
6. A disrupted economy: Economic hardship will develop as a result of break down of constitutional rule. People may not use the due process of the law to employ qualified people into businesses and this will bring about bottlenecks in production. This means unqualified people will be employed at the expense of qualified people. In addition to this, if a country experiences war, businesses may not be able to produce more goods for export to generate enough foreign exchange to undertake further production. Lack of foreign exchange to purchase raw materials and import machines and spare parts may affect the productive capacity of businesses. This may result in inadequate supply of food and manufactured goods on the market and consequently lead to inflation.\n\n\
7. A break down of constitutional rule discourages foreign investment and assistance. Investors are always ready to invest in an economic where there is political stability. Political stability guarantees economic stab1hty, and a country which does not possess these qualities is disincentive to foreign investment and assistance. This is because political instability makes investment in such a country a risky enterprise and investors would not venture to commit their resources into such an economy.\n\n\
8. General instability and confusion: Break down of constitutional rule makes people live in fear and feel insecure. This situation may lead to people leaving the country to other neighbouring countries to seek asylum or find Jobs to do. Again, such a country can experience unimaginable chaos as social vices such as armed robbery, pick pocketing, drug addiction, chronic , unemployment, shortages etc may be at its peak ."

{
id: "question6b",
question: "6b. Explain four conditions under which the right of an individual can be violated. [16 marks]",
options: "\
1. Breach of the peace: Breach of the law usually leads to prosecution and conviction which curtail an individuals right of free movement. If an individual is arraigned before a court of law for breaking the law or committing an offence, the exercise of his rights and liberties may be limited, especially if the offender is remanded in custody. Law breakers and armed robbers may be convicted or put in prisons to ease social tension. The confinement will restrict the offender's right of movement, and also suffer some agony. Again, if the government is convinced that some people are engaging in unlawful associations designed to undermine law and order e.g. forming syndicates to steal or kill or overthrow a government in power, the government may prevent the activity from taking place. This will interfere with the individual's political rights.\n\n\
2. Security: When the security of the state is threatened, the state may declare a state of emergency or impose an overnight curfew. Thus, limiting the freedom of movement e.g. outbreak of war or coup d'etat. The individual's rights could be violated when public order or national security is required e.g. during periods of siege or crisis, curfew, state of emergency etc. When the government declares a state of emergency or imposes a curfew, the curfew will affect the individual's freedom of movement and may suffer some other inconvenience. Individuals may also be debarred from entering places of strategic importance eg. Military installations, etc.\n\n\
3. Someone's life can be taken as a result of the use of reasonable force to prevent a person from committing a crime.\n\n\
4. Disasters natural or artificial: The outbreak of disasters which may threaten life and property may lead to the adoption of certain measures which could violate the rights of the individual. When natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, etc. occur restriction could be placed on the freedom of movement of people.\n\n\
5. On the grounds of insanity, health eg. lunatics etc.: Persons who are mentally and physically unsound have to be confined in psychiatric or mental hospitals or isolated from society. This limits their right to exercise their freedom of movement. When an individual is positively diagnosed with contagious diseases such as tuberculosis he/she may be quarantined to avoid the spread of the disease. This may limit somebody's movement, because such a disease may spread. By keeping such people in isolated areas they are prevented from exercising their right.\n\n\
6. The need to preserve peace and order leads to the enactment of laws whose application may limit the rights of the individual. For example, when the security agencies recognize that a particular public gathering may lead to a disturbance of public peace; there can be denial of permit. Assembling in any way and possessing arms with a view to overthrow the constitution attract death penalty when found guilty.\n\n\
7. The laws of libel, slander and sedition: The laws of the libel, slander and sedition also violate the rights of an individual's freedom of speech and action. Such law's do not allow and individual to publish anything, say anything or do anything designed to defame or injure the reputation of another person or to incite public disorder or rebellion against the government"

question: "7b. Describe four roles of a husband in the Ghanaian society. [16 marks] SECTION C SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT",
options: "\
1. The Head of the nuclear family: -The husband is the head and breadwinner of the family; he provides the material needs of the family. He therefore performs such responsibilities like provision of food, clothing, shelter. He works hard to get enough money to provide these basic necessities of life. He is obliged to pay for the necessary aspects of children's education. He plays the father to all members of the family without any discrimination and so the welfare of the members is his concern.\n\n\
2. Financial commitment: The husband provides the financial needs of the family. He is usually the one who pays all the bills, that is, payment of school fees, rent, donations, water and electricity bills. When a member of the family is sick, it is the husband who has to take the one to the hospital and settle the hospital bills. He provides the house keeping money for the wife to enable her prepare food for family\n\n\
3. Provide moral and spiritual training :The husband is expected to take the lead in socializing family members by setting good example for the family members to follow. He must be honest, tolerant, fair, firm and truthful in all his dealings with the family members. The husband is also expected to ensure discipline in the family. He should check waywardness among the children and ensure moral training of the children so that they develop good character from undesirable external influences. Itis the duty of the husband to maintain law and order at home.\n\n\
4. Settles disputes: The husband settles disputes in the family and between the family and other people. He therefore solves quarrels between the children and between the children and their mother. He sees to it that there is peace and harmony in the family. As family head of the family he promotes unity by arbitrating and settling marital problems and misunderstanding in the family.\n\n\
5. Sexual Satisfaction: The husband satisfies the sexual and other emotional needs of the wife. The husband ensures that her wife gets the sexual satisfaction that she needs so that together with her they produce children into the family. The role of procreation ensures the continuity of the family line. The husband gives love and affection to the family members. He comforts the wife when she is sad and solves her problems to make her happy.\n\n\
6. Protection/Security of the family: The husband provides security and protection from bad influences outside the family and also from both spiritual and physical. Because of the physical strength of the husband, he is expected to protect his family against any physical attack or harm by other people. He defends the family members from any outside attacks. As spiritual head of the family, he occasionally pours libation to ask the gods to protect the family. He also makes sure that he goes to church/mosque with children and ensures that they attend Sunday school.\n\n\
7. Commitment to nuclear and extended family: The husband is obliged to help his nuclear and extended family members when they are in need. He therefore cares for his extended family members. He has to send money home for the upkeep of his father and mother and make sure that he takes care of at least one or two of the extended family members in school or comes to stay with him. It is also the responsibility of the husband in seeing to the financial needs of his in- laws. He has to help his wife's relatives especially the parents of the woman to show that he is grateful to them for having given their daughter to him in marriage.\n\n\
8. Social Obligations: It is the responsibility of the husband represent the family at social gatherings and other community engagements. He is therefore obliged to attend funerals with the wife and take part in all communal labour in the community. He must also participate in cultural festivals that take place in the community. Since it is the man who has to pour libation, it makes the man's presence very necessary and important at family and other social gatherings.\n\n\
9. Ensures that marriage rites are properly done. Since the man is the head of the family, he is expected to be present at naming and marriage ceremonies involving family members to ensure that the traditional aspects of these ceremonies are properly done. It is the duty of the husband to ensure that members of the family who are giving out in marriage follow the traditional marriage rites e.g. making a formal request for hand of the girl in marriage, knocking at the door, bride wealth/brie etc.\n\n\
10. The husband ensures that members of the family acquire vocational skills needed to earn a living. He should ensure that the girls learn sewing, bakery and boys learn carpentry etc."

question: "8b. In what four ways are natural resources beneficial to Ghanaians? [16 marks]",
definition: "The following are some of the ways by which natural resources are beneficial to Ghanaians:",
options: "\
1. Source of foreign exchange: Natural resources such as minerals, timber, hydro-electric power, cocoa etc. constitute major source of foreign exchange to the government of Ghana. Ghana produces cocoa and several non-traditional export commodities (pineapple, kola-nuts, yam, cashew nuts etc.) and forest products - notably timber for export. The export of dry cocoa beans as well as several non traditional export commodities and timber contributed about $449 million or 43% of the total foreign exchange earned in 1993.\n\n\
2. Provides Employment:- Natural resources offer employment to a large proportion of the labour as farmers, fishermen, hunters, miners, loggers and farm labour. The agricultural and mining sectors offer employment to a large active labour force. These employment opportunities help to alleviated poverty and to reduce social vices in the country. As a source of employment, natural resources provide income to farmers who produce oranges, mangoes pineapples, apples etc. and sell them at the market.\n\n\
3. Source of revenue: Natural resources contribute substantially to government revenue mainly through duties paid on the export of natural resources, particularly cocoa. Royalties from companies and timber concessions form sizable proportion of government revenue.\n\n\
4. Provides food and water for use by humans: Natural resources provide food for the expanding rural and urban population. Almost all the food we eat comes from plants and/or animals, e.g. plantain, yam, cassava, sorghum, plantain, yam, cassava and cocoyam, beans, rice, fish, poultry and livestock. Our rivers provide water for domestic and industrial uses. Natural resources in addition to providing food for the people contribute to direct satisfaction of human wants by providing wood fuel, fish, bush meat etc. We use water for cooking, washing and providing electricity for the economic development of the country.\n\n\
5. Water bodies are source of generating hydro- electric power for industrial and domestic use Industries use electricity to turn their machines to produce goods for domestic and export markets. Example are the Volta Lake and Bui projects.\n\n\
6. Provision of raw materials for agro-based industries: Natural resources supply raw materials like cocoa, cola-nut, palm oil, timber, cassava, gold, diamond, salt, etc. for the agro-based industries. Examples are fruit and fish canneries, manufacturers of jewels also depend on gold and diamond. Furniture manufacturers also depend on timber for their production. Ameen Sangari Industry in Cape Coast depends on local palm oil as a source of its raw material to produce Ameen Soap.\n\n\
7. Tourist Attraction: Natural parks (Kakum National Park), Boti falls, crocodile pond at Paga, Beach resorts etc. are tourist sites which attract foreigners to such placés of interest.\n\n\
9. Natural resources provide means of transport: Water, air and land are used for transport purposes. Canoes and boats are used on rivers and lakes, while ships and other large vessels ply the seas. Water transport in the movement of people and goods.\n\n\
8. Natural resources provide water for irrigation. For example, the Tano Irrigation Project enables farmers to farm throughout the whole year. Through irrigation farmers can undertake rice farming and so to plant vegetables like tomato, onions etc throughout the year\n\n\
10. Medicinal plants for the prevention and cure of diseases: Forests are a source of drugs. The barks, roots, leaves etc. of trees are used by herbalists and others for treatment of illnesses and diseases. For example, the bark and leaves of some trees like mahogany and sapele are used as medicine for treating diseases like piles, and waist pains. Also manufactures of medicine also depend on trees for their drug (aspirin, quinine, chloroquine, etc.).commodities, thereby facilitating trade."

question: "9. Explain five ways by which socio-economic development problems in Ghana can be addressed. [20 marks]",
definition: "The following are some of the ways by which socio-economic development problems of Ghana can be solved:",
options: "\
1. Provision of skills training for manpower to reduce the use of foreign manpower: Socio economic development problems of Ghana can be addressed if skills training institutions like polytechnics, technical and vocational schools and trade centres are established in towns and cities to train mechanics, technicians, engineers, brick layers, etc. to increase the number of skilled personnel as well as middle-level manpower for the country. Such skilled personnel are needed to produce machine tools and parts for factory machines instead of importing them. Apostle Kwadwo Safo of Kristo Asafo has established trade centres where he trains young men and women to produce incubator which operates on Kerosine, improved versions of the Rocket and Robot.\n\n\
2. Provision of adequate capital and credit facilities for industrial development. The government of Ghana can increase the number of Development Banks in the country so that entrepreneurs in rural and urban centres can easily access credit. Entrepreneurs can access credit or loans from banks if their interest rates on loans are not high. High interest rates will later prospective entrepreneurs from accessing credit from banks. Such loans will enable entrepreneurs to acquire machines and equipment and also import raw materials which cannot be acquired locally. The National investment and Agricultural Development Banks were established specifically to assist industrialists and farmers to acquire loans to expand their business.\n\n\
3. Provision of education to equip the people with literacy/numeracy skills: Schools often provide basic education and lead to increased literacy/ or numeracy skills. Literacy makes mass communication easier and opens the way for people to learn for themselves and obtain new ideas and information. For example, a literate farmer can read and follow instructions in the application of fertilizer and adopt modern methods of farming which will increase his level of output as against an illiterate farmer who cannot read.\n\n\
4. Ensuring positive attitude to work; Punctuality, hard work, honesty etc. Ghanaians should change their attitude to work by being punctual at work, using their working hours wisely. Workers should have the quality of being honest. A worker who has this quality will avoid pilfering and cheating at workplace as this will lead to a fall of the business organization. Employers expect to employ workers who have selfless devotion to work since such workers are dedicated to the work and do not waste time on other things that have no bearing with the work assigned to them.\n\n\
5. Adopting appropriate farming practices: Farmers must be encouraged to adopt moden farming practices like clearing their land and prepare it in lines, which helps in easy weeding and control of pests and diseases. Planting in lines allows for easy harvesting and results in higher yield. Farmers must be encouraged to acquire agricultural machinery like ploughs, tractors, planters and harvesters for large-scale agricultural production. Extension officers must encourage farmers to go into livestock rearing so that they can use their dropping as manure and reduce the use organic fertilizer.\n\n\
6. Provision of affordable housing schemes: The government can undertake housing schemes for both the rural urban people. In the rural areas, for example, burnt bricks can be used to build cheap houses for them and encouraged to pay from the sales they make from their farming activities. In the urban centres, high rise buildings can be put up since land acquisition may be difficult. Workers can be encouraged to rent and later make outright purchase where necessary.\n\n\
7. Public education e.g good health and sanitation etc. The use of the news media-radio, television and the daily papers in making the general public aware of the need to keep their surroundings clean and protect the environment from pollution should be intensified. Every individual should be made responsible for the proper disposal of his or her waste. People should be advised not to throw rubbish or used rubbers around but put them in disposal containers which should put vantage points in the towns and cities. People living along the beaches must be advised to stop defecating on the beaches since such practices can easily affect the health of the people and also discourage tourists who visit our beaches.\n\n\
7. Population control to reduce dependency burden: The government can control the population by encouraging people to adopt family planning which will offer people with opportunities to consciously decide freely and responsibly on the number of children they wish to have and when to have them by spacing the birth of their children. Again, the government can provide family planning clinics where married couples and the youth can go for advice or information on birth control measures. There should be very effective information, education, and communication programmes on family life education especially in our educational institutions. The effect of this policy is that family size will reduce which will reduce dependency burden and improve the standard of living of the people.\n\n\
9. Effective monitoring and supervision. Social-economic development problems of Ghana can be addressed through supervision. Businesses should ensure that there are supervisors around who are always on the look out for signs of laziness, unnecessary loitering etc. Where supervision and monitoring of workers is not very strict and workers tend to loiter about, converse and work lotto thereby wasting man-hours, productivity tend to fall.\n\n\
10. Reliance and patronizing made in Ghana goods. Foreign cultural influences have affected the demand for locally made goods like food, leather works and clothes. There is therefore the need to reverse this trend. The youth must patronize locally produced goods as this will go a long way to increase demand for these goods and also help to improve the quality of the goods through suggestions and comments they make to producers. As more youth patronize locally made goods there will be an increase in demand for the goods and this will encourage producers to employ more youth to produce these goods for local use and for export to earn more foreign exchange for the country's socio-economic development.\n\n\
11. Monitoring trade liberalization policies to prevent importation of shoddy goods to ux the local market: Trade liberalization encourages inflow of imports. However where such imports are not monitored they lead to flooding of our markets of all sorts cheap and poor quality goods such as drugs, electrical cables and equipment, textiles, used tyres and clothing etc. The government can ban goods which are produced locally but are imported and which compete with our locally produced goods. Since these imported goods are cheaper people patronize them to the neglect of the local products. Local industries which produce these goods may face low sales or low demand and this can affect the output of these industries."

question: "10b. Outline four ways of sustaining a business enterprise. [16 marks]",
options: "\
1. Recruitment of qualified personnel: The entrepreneur must ensure that he employs qualified personnel who have the requisite qualifications and skills needed in the business to meet more challenging jobs which ultimately lead to greater productivity.\n\n\
2. Plough - back profits into business: Another measure that can be adopted to ensure the sustainability of a business enterprise is the entrepreneur to reinvest profits into business with a view to expanding it. The reinvested profits can be use to expand the factory space or acquire new machines and equipment or purchase more raw materials to increase output. When a business expands, it needs more capital to sustain it and profits that accrue from the capital invested must not be spent on frivolous things that do not produce more wealth.\n\n\
3. Maintaining good inter-personal relationship and high morale: The entrepreneur should establish a good relationship with his workers. He should ensure that the well fare of his workers are met as well as their domestic needs. This creates a happy environment for the workers to Work assiduously to maximize productivity and hence sustain the business.\n\n\
4. Motivation of workers: Workers should be adequately rewarded by their employers for their hard work and achievement with attractive incentive packages in the form of television sets, deep freezers, bonuses, scholarships for children of hard working workers, sponsorship for further training, promotions to high grades and good pension schemes. Service conditions of workers should also be improved by providing them with loan facilities to enable them purchase their own means of transport, build houses, pay for their children's education, and have free health services, including children and spouses and free canteen services among others. Workers should also be given adequate salaries, wages and allowances so as to avoid the situation where workers leave their work places to do other jobs for additional income. This will in effect lessen pilfering, embezzlement, falsification of accounts and other malpractices.\n\n\
5. Good attitude towards work: A worker should be punctual, regular, highly committed to his work. He should have respect for time and report early for work. He should not leave his work unattended to and walk aimlessly about. A worker with a high sense of duty shows concern, care and compassion in dealing with the business public. Goods and services are delivered on time to customers and with maximum amount of care.\n\n\
6. Avoiding nepotism: Favouritism and tribalism can hinder development. In this respect, the best qualified person should be appointed to do a job so that the job would be well done. In some work places employers employ their relatives who do not have the requisite qualifications to handle certain positions but are made to be there. Such relations naturally become informants to the employers and seldom face any disciplinary action since it becomes difficult to enforce discipline among relatives, tribesmen, friends and favourites. When this happens, discipline breaks down workers misbehave and productivity decrease.\n\n\
7. Effective management /Supervision: An entrepreneur can ensure the sustainability of a business enterprise by adopting proper supervision to check negative attitude on the part of the workers. When workers are poorly supervised, they may absent themselves from work or come to work late. Supervisors should ensure that good working habits are exhibited at offices and gives directives as to how work should be done."
