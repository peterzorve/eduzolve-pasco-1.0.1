question: "1. As an adolescent, justify five irresponsible behaviours you must avoid.",
definition: "The following are some of the irresponsible behaviours an adolescent must avoid.",
options: "\
1. Pre-marital sex: Boyfriend-girlfriend relationship usually leads to sexual intercourse before marriage. Such a relationship can lead to unwanted pregnancy, STDs, abortions, death etc. A pregnant school girl cannot continue her education and will have to drop out of school. This impedes her progress on the academic ladder and cuts short her dream of becoming either a lawyer, doctor or a nurse. It is important that the moral virtue of chastity is upheld by the adolescent until marriage.\n\n\
2. Prostitution: This is engagement in promiscuous sexual activities due to lust or maternal gains. Prostitution can result from poor parental care which can make the adolescent indulge in sexual activities to feed and cloth herself. The girl child who indulges in prostitution can contract STDs, and this can lead to sickness and death.\n\n\
3. Drug abuse: Drug abuse is the use of drugs not prescribed by a qualified medical officer. Some adolescents smoke hard drugs e.g. Indian hemp, cannabis, cocaine etc out of frustration and bad peer influence. This can lead to crime and mental disorders. An adolescent who indulges in drugs will not be able to learn well to enable him/her pass his/her examination. He/she will be a drop out and become a deviant in the society. Those who indulge in crime can be prosecuted and sent to a borstal home.\n\n\
4. Homosexuality: Homosexuality is in the form of sodomy and lesbianism where people of the same sex engage in sexual activities. Adolescents who engage in homosexuality are likely to contract STDs and other venerable diseases. Such sexual activities tarnish the image of the adolescents and their parents. Homosexuality must be avoided by adolescents since this act threatens the continuity of family as an institution.\n\n\
5. Watching pornographic materials: In this modern world, many adolescents have access to the internet, TV and other social plat forms on their small phones from where they can easily watch pornographic materials. Adolescents can have access to pornographic materials on newsstand also buy CDs containing pornographic materials. Watching pornographic materials can increase the sexual urge of the youth which leads to sexual abuse like rape and obsession.\n\n\
6. Armed robbery: Adolescents engage in armed robbery as a result of drug abuse and lust for material things. This is a common feature among adolescents these days since the youth are engaged in armed robbery as a means of survival or under the influence of peer pressure. The result of this is that as they use weapons to rob people this can lead to loss of life (since innocent people are killed) and the youth engaged in this illegal act can be apprehended and imprisoned.\n\n\
7. Examination malpractices: Many students do not sturdy hard towards school examinations. They therefore engage in cheating and other forms of examination irregularities. They patronize leaked questions which may be fake or smuggle mobile phones into the examination hall. Some students also smuggle prepared answers on sheets etc. into the examination room. The result of this bad behaviour is that it can lead to the cancellation of examination results of the student(s) (or the entire results of the school) and barring from taking examination for some number of years.\n\n\
8. Flouting of the authority of teachers, parents and elders in society: Adolescents show very little or no respect for their teachers and elders these days. Students who are under the influence of drugs and alcohol engage in hot arguments with their teachers, parents and elders and sometimes even fight them. Students who engage in such behaviour can be suspended or withdrawn from school. Adolescents who show disrespect to elders by manhandling or insulting them can be prosecuted which can result in withdrawal of privileges, imprisonments and poor image.\n\n\
9. Bad peer influence: Adolescents usually convince their colleagues to form gangs and engage themselves in all kinds of nefarious activities such as drug abuse, rape, armed robbery etc. Adolescents who engage in such activities can find themselves being sanctioned. This means that bad peer influence can lead adolescents into trouble with the law enforcing agents. For example, adolescents who indulge in drugs, armed robbery, prostitution etc and are caught can be prosecuted, imprisoned or sent to borstal homes for reformation.\n\n\
10. Vandalism and Hooliganism: Some adolescents allow themselves to be used for vandalism and destruction of public property and which may cause other peopleâ€™s lives. When these adolescents are arrested, they can be sanctioned and sent to juvenile homes for correction. Again, funds which can be used to improve other sectors of the economy and provide social amenities and infrastructure are used to replace the property destroyed.\n\n\
11. Laziness: This is the unwillingness to put much effort to work leading to non-performance in school and life. Students who do not show seriousness in their academic work end up getting low grades in their final examination and cannot achieve their aim of becoming a doctor, engineer, accountant etc.\n\n\
12. Truancy and absenteeism: This involve running away from school and other social gatherings that provide opportunity for development. Some students are fond of cutting classes and reporting for classes late the result is that they will lose the lessons thought and this can affect their progress in class and terminal examinations. Students who also run away from social gatherings like debate, entertainment, etc loose the opportunity to interact and meet students from other schools and learn from them."

4. Acquisition of home management skills: Women must learn to acquire home management to marry skills including cooking, serving meals, washing clothes and care for children. This is for every woman who wants to because these days there are some women who cannot prepare soup and stew. This is because when they were adolescents their parents did not teach home is is very necessary Some adolescents also buy all the food they eat from restaurants and cop bars and management skills. Some therefore by the time they marry they had acquired no techniques of cooking and home care.\n\n\
5. Accessing Counselling Services: Accessing counselling services helps to gain much insight into marriage as an institution. It guides partners to appreciate situations and conditions in the marriage and relate well with each other. They can also work on any emotional challenges they may have.\n\n\

The father has to protect the children from bullies and peer influences like stealing, fighting etc. that can mar the future of the children.\n\n\
9. Getting the bride wealth ready: The bride wealth is the prescribed items the manâ€™s family presents to the womanâ€™s family. The bride wealth must be ready so that when the marriage process is officially initiated the groom will not be found wanting. The prescribed items known as bride wealth or bride price demanded by the womanâ€™s family may vary from place to place and may be dependent on the status of the woman or her religious affiliation.\n\n\

id: "question3",
question: "3. Examine five effects of responsible parenting on the child",
definition: "The following are some of the effects of responsible parenting on the child:",
options: "\
1. The child who receives proper parenting will grow up to become useful and responsible in the society. If the child has been brought up by responsible parents who donâ€™t drink, fight, quarrel or lead promiscuous life and since children learn quickly, they will surely grow up to be responsible. Again, children who come from homes where their parents assist in community activities the children learn from them and also exhibit such qualities.\n\n\
2. One effect of responsible parenting on the child is that it brings about disciplined and peace-loving children who appreciate tolerance and harmonious living. A child who is well cared for and his parents are good mannered people will grow up to become happy and active in the society. This will enable the child to be polite and kind to his friends and will be ready to assist and share the little he/she has.\n\n\
3. Another effect of responsible parenting on the child is that the child will be able to relate to all manner of people and different situations. A child who grows up from a home where his/her parents are respectful to people they meet or visit their home will emulate such good character trait because that is what he has been taught by their parents. A child who is well trained can easily adapt to any situation he/she finds him/herself and can interact and associate with friends from different backgrounds easily.\n\n\
4. Reduction in crime: Good parenting trains the child to be of good behaviour and to live good moral life. For example, a child from a good home will not engage in armed robbery or in drugs which will land him or her in prison. Such a child will not flout the authority of his/her parents but will take the advice of his/her parents. Such a child will also raise the image of himself and his/her parents and reduce crime in the society.\n\n\
5. Another effect of responsible parenting on the child is that it brings about the transmission of the cultural values and norms of the society to the child. A child from a good home will be taught values such as modesty, respect, concern for others, tolerance, patience etc. 6. Another effect of responsible parenting on the child is that it creates a peaceful atmosphere in the home for the child. For example, a child who grows up in a home where the parents are respectful and non-violent when interacting with others will show the same behaviour to other children. A child who is raised from a happy home will feel happy and interact freely with all the family members since he/she sees them as one family\n\n\
7. One effect of responsible parenting is that it takes care of the health needs of children leading to a society with healthy people with sound mind. A child who grows up in a home where parents provide his/her health needs is likely to grow healthy and will not often fall sick and can therefore attend school regularly. Such a child will have good attendance at school and can perform. better than his/her friends who often fall sick as a result of poor health care. Since a healthy people with a sound mind is an assert to the society parents must ensure that they provide the health needs of their children when they are sick since they will grow to become a healthy adult.\n\n\
8. Responsible parenting has the effect of making children acquire sense of loyalty and patriotism. Parents can instil in their children the need to volunteer time and skills in the community i.e. communal labour, and communal work. Children must be made to know the need to participate in teamwork whenever possible and not hurting others and also standing up for those who canâ€™t stand up for themselves.\n\n\
9. Responsible parenting also has the effect of equipping children with occupational skills for life long living. Parents provide occupational or domestic training such as childcare, cookery, washing, bakery, sewing, fishing, carpentry and home management so that the children will grow up to become responsible adults who can take care of the family using the skills they had acquired. Children from such homes can fit into the society and not be a burden on the society.\n\n\
10. One of the effects of responsible parenting on the child is that it makes it possible for the discovery of the childâ€™s talent and potential so that they can be harnessed to the fullest. Good parents are able to unearth the potentials of their children as they grow and direct them where necessary. For example, children with good talents become visible when they are adolescents and it depends on parents to develop such talents whether it is footballing, music, drawing, dancing, bakery, cooking etc.\n\n\
11. Responsible parenting builds confidence and initiative of the child. Good parenting enables the child to handle problems and not to rely on other people for solutions. Such a child will also think of successes rather than failures and focus on his/her strengths to achieve his/her set goals rather than on his/her weaknesses or deficiencies. Parents must therefore reward their children when verbally or with material gifts when the child achieves some feat like passing an exam or performing well in debate or scoring a goal in a march."

{
id: "question4b",
question: "4b. Discuss four ways by which education can effectively be used to bring about rapid social change in Ghana.",
definition: "The following are some of the ways by which education can bring about rapid social change in Ghana:",
options: "\
1. Education must inculcate good citizenship in Ghanaians as a basis for effective participation in national development. Students in various institutions should be taught the national pledge, anthem and the national symbols. These symbols should be explained thoroughly so that students will come out of school as patriotic people ready to contribute their quota to the national development. As patriotic students they must be ready to accept postings to the remotest part of the country to work as national service personnel.\n\n\
2. Education must lay the foundation for enquiry and creativity equipping the individual with skills to search for new scientific knowledge / mental liberation. In this way, outmoded cultural practices like the trokosi system, female genital mutilation (FGM), widowhood rites etc which militate against the development of women in the society have received condemnation from women activists. Through formal education the Ghanaian mind is now liberated from myths and superstitious beliefs, prejudice against females and ignorance, which were hindrances to development. People attributed sickness, famine, strange disease etc to ancestors but through formal education people now know that many sicknesses may be due to poor sanitation or uncleanliness. Education now brings with it enlightenment on the need for punctuality, discipline and peace for national development.\n\n\
3. Education must be made to develop in the individual sound moral attitudes that will promote character building. This will encourage citizens to be morally upright and the need to do the right thing at all times. Moral values such as being honest and trustworthy, being patient etc can be instilled in the individual through the teaching of moral studies at school.\n\n\
4. Education must enable the Ghanaian to develop a healthy appreciation of the countryâ€™s cultural values for national integration. Education must bring about social cohesion and eschew all forms of ethnocentrism. As individuals are enlightened on the various ethnic groups, they tend to understand the culture of the various ethnic groups and embrace them. Individuals must not look down on the culture of other ethnic groups as inferior but understand that we are all one people with diverse cultures.\n\n\
5. Education must be structured to equip the individual with knowledge and practical skills for employment. The educational system must train the youth in the acquisition of skills in areas, like cake making, bead making, soap making, preparation of soft drinks, bakery, construction etc. The acquisition of such practical skills will enable individuals to set up their businesses and also train the youth to also acquire such skills.\n\n\
6. Education must meet the needs of society, e.g. people with skilled labour and professionals such as teachers, doctors, engineers, etc. Education produces skilled personnel in various fields of endeavour. For example, doctors, nurses, teachers etc after their training can decide to work in any part of the country. The training that teachers, doctors, engineers and nurses acquire must enable them to work in our rural areas so that the skills and knowledge that they had acquired as a doctor or nurse or midwife can help them to save the lives of sick people, pregnant mothers, children etc.\n\n\
7. Education must suggest trend for the growth of society e.g. development of appropriate technology. Education must lay emphasis on the youth acquiring vocational and technical skills to meet the needs of the society. Since the country is endowed with raw materials to make soap, tooth pick, jewellery, soft drinks, etc. the local artisan can make simple machines to produce large quantities of soap, tooth pick, jewellery etc for local and external use. An example of appropriate technology is the fufu pounding machine, which is used in chop bars and homes.\n\n\
8. Education must enable the individual become conscious of his identity as a Ghanaian. As an individual, education must change oneâ€™s attitude towards Ghanaian food, dressing foreign culture etc. For example, education must enable individuals to eat Ghanaian food and put on clothes that are manufactured in Ghana. This will enable people become conscious of their identity as Ghanaians.\n\n\
9. Education must take into consideration the population dynamics in order to make the necessary projections of the need of the people. The rate of population growth of Ghana is increasing faster than the available resources so there is the need to limit the growth of population through serious and massive campaign to encourage families to reduce the number of children they can birth to. The government must use the mass media and the information service to advise people to adopt family planning which will offer them with opportunities to consciously decide freely and responsibly on the number of children they wish to have and when to have them by spacing the birth of their children as a means of controlling the population of the country. There should be very effective information on family life education especially in our educational institutions. The effect of this policy is that family size will reduce which will reduce dependency burden and improve the standard of living of the people.\n\n\
10. Education must help to improve the standard of living in terms of housing, health delivery, sanitation, transportation and communication. Education must train people with skills in medicine, midwifery, engineering, communication etc. As individuals acquire such skills the government can post them to areas where their services are needed to improve health of the people and also ensure that roads are motorable to make easy movement of people and goods. When people acquire education they can improve keep their environment clean, eat better food and live in decent environment which all help to improve their standard of living.\n\n\
11. Education must train people to assume leadership positions. Through education, people must develop the virtues and leadership skills that would enable them to face the up-hill tasks and responsibilities that lie ahead of them. There are many educational institutions like GIMPA which has enabled many people to acquire leadership skills and who are now occupying many leadership positions in the country e.g. New MDCs, MCES, DCEâ€™s, Assembly men and women and other government officials are usually given courses and attend seminars in leadership before they assume duty in their respective fields."

question: "5b. Describe four conditions necessary for peace building in Ghana.",
definition: "Some of the conditions necessary for peace building may be stated as follows:",
options: "\
1. Respect for Human Rights: All persons have the same rights and therefore the rights of all persons must be respected by all. We should not allow anybody to deny us of our rights. We should also not look down on other peopleâ€™s rights and freedoms. People in conflict must try as much as possible to smoke the peace pipe and not to take the law into their own hands but must respect the rights of people. When we respect rights of one another we will not look down on other people in the society. Everybody is important in the society so we should show respect for people so that they also would respect us.\n\n\
2. Tolerance: There will be peace building if individuals tolerate the views and beliefs of other individuals. We should listen to the different views of people and appreciate what other peoplesâ€™ say or feel about some of the things we do. Accepting views, opposing views and ways of life other people enable peace building to take place.\n\n\
3. Forgiveness/love: Groups or parties in conflict must be prepared to forgive and forget what has happened in the past. They should not try to recount that past experience towards each other and assume that nothing has happened in the past and forge forward for progress. People should therefore cultivate and display the act of pardoning others when they are wronged.\n\n\
4. Justice and fairness: Peace building promotes fairness. We should show fairness in our dealings with other people. Cheating on your friend would create hatred and make you an enemy to your friend. We should therefore try to be fair with our friends wherever we are. We should be fair and just in our society and not to accuse or blame people falsely. We should as much as possible be mindful of accusing people innocently as this can lead to conflict. There should be no discrimination in assessing fair trial at the law courts. The government must try as much as possible to distribute the countries development projects and wealth fairly so that each region or district can get its fair share of the national cake in order not to generate bitterness and conflict among the people. Compromise: When there is conflict we should try as much as possible to compromise or agree to concerns raised by other people when there is the need. Parties involved should therefore not take entrenched positions but must be prepared to accept opposing views or meet each other half way when there is a problem or an agreement.\n\n\
5. Honesty: People must deal truthfully with others and admit their fault when it occurs. It is through admission of fault that reconciliation, forgiveness can take place.\n\n\
6. Right conduct: Individuals must live according to the standard set by society. People must live according to the norms and values of the society. In this way we must behave in a manner that will not result in our being caught up with the law. We must not drink to the point of fighting and destroying result in bel peoplesâ€™ property. When we behave in a decent way we have the best of mind set to concentrate on positive things in the community.\n\n\
7. Existence of conflict resolution institutions: Institutions should be established and mandated to resolve conflicts before they escalate. When conflicts crop up we should use Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) methods like mediation. With mediation, lawyers with interest in such matters or the National Peace Council, people who are respected in the society or people who are knowledgeable in dispute resolution can help to settle disputes between people so that such conflicts do not drag on for many years in the law courts or escalate into war.\n\n\
8. Consensus building: Consensus building is the agreement reached by parties involved in conflict and this helps promote peace and harmonious living in the society. In consensus building there should be general widespread agreement on issues to the extent that conflict situations becomes non-existent.\n\n\
9. Negotiation/Agreement: Negotiation involves reaching an agreement on set goals and objectives through di discussion and compromise. We should be prepared to sit down with other people to dialogue, and negotiate so that there will be peace building. In arbitration we should use an independent person to provide judgement in dispute which is binding on the contending parties. For example, in chieftaincy matters, the National House of Chiefs can institute a committee to look into such matters and solve them in the interest of peace.\n\n\
10. Efficient law enforcement system: The police should be given the necessary logistics and they should be willing and committed to enforce and maintain law and order in the society. If the police are sufficiently resourced, that is, if they are have enough vehicles and men, mob control equipment etc. they can respond to such situations promptly to bring peace and order to the community.\n\n\
11. Promoting good governance: Peace building can be promoted through good governance. For free and fair election to prevail in a democratic state the electoral commission must use transparent ballot boxes in all polling stations so that when someone drops his or her ballot papers into the ballot box it will be seen by everyone. This will prevent people from voting double. Again, if the ballot box is not transparent the electorate will not be clear in their conscience if the ballot box is not already stuffed with ballot papers by the ruling government. For the electorate to accept the verdict of the electoral process and for peace to prevail, the ballot box must be transparent and be put in the open for the electorate to see.\n\n\
12. Discouraging ethnocentrism: The government must do everything to control the believe that some tribes or ethnic groups and their culture are superior and better than other tribes. Where one or two ethnic groups belief that their language is widely spoken and at the same time their way of life is generally accepted this can create a situation where such ethnic group can begin to look down on minority ethnic groups and this can bring about conflict."

options: "\
1. Inadequate resources: Ghana faces the problem of inadequate human and capital resources to tap her natural resources and to expand existing industries and start new ones. This makes it difficult for all regions to access the national cake equally leading to complaints and disgruntlement over uneven distribution of countryâ€™s industries, sports stadia. Many industrialists and businessmen cannot access loans from banks to expand their businesses because of high interest rate.\n\n\
2. Uneven distribution of development projects: Most development projects are sited in the regional and district capitals. So it is very common to find all industries and factories located in Tema, Accra, Kumasi, Takoradi etc. leaving many rural areas with no projects. The effect of this uneven distribution of development projects across the country leads to some areas lagging behind others in development.\n\n\
3. Political intolerance: There is unhealthy political atmosphere and rivalry among the various political parties which are likely to affect national unity and nation building. Political communicators who talk on the various radio stations are very intolerant because of the way they react to the views of their opponents. The abusive language, which some party officials and their communicators inflict on their opponents are recipe for disturbance and instability in the country.\n\n\
4. Ignorance: Many people are not well informed on important national issues. This is because many Ghanaians cannot read and write and therefore cannot give proper interpretation of national. issues discussed on the national media. This explains why during the 2012 elections many Ghanaians could not thumb print in the right way and so the spoilt ballot papers were even more than votes received by some of the parties which lost in the election."

1. In a buoyant economy there is a healthy growth in all sectors of the economy e.g. agriculture, industry, mining, trade and commerce, transportation and other services such as banking. insurance and communication. Since all the sectors perform well in the country output of each sector will be high. Individuals in the country can enjoy variety of goods and services at affordable prices leading to rise in the standard of living of the people.\n\n\
2. Existence of improvement in infrastructure: In a buoyant economy, infrastructural pols, electricity, telecommunication systems are highly roads, hospitals, schools, facilities such developed. This will enable easy and fast movement of goods, raw materials and labour. It is now very easy for businessmen to communicate and transact business with their business partners through the internet or smart phones without the need to travel to meet a business partner.\n\n\
3. Increase in per capita income: The per capita income refers to how much each person in a country would obtain if the whole income of the nation (National Income) is shared equally among all persons in the country. This means that in a buoya is an increase in the level of total output of goods better standard of living which also means that there is yah a high per capita income which leads to and services which people can buy leading to a higher level of consumption and increased standard of living\n\n\
4. Reduction in unemployment: In a buoyant economy because there is a healthy growth in all living. sectors of the economy and infrastructural facilities are better developed, so that industrial growth is very high. As a result there is there is very high opportunity for citizens to be employed in industries, agriculture, commerce, banks, insurance companies etc. to enable them contribute to their quota to national development.\n\n\
5. High literacy rate/low literacy rate: In a buoyant economy, there is high literacy rate which leads to increased enlightenment for better understanding of socio-economic issues and national decision- making. In a country like Japan, Germany etc. which enjoying a b t economy majority oft of the people can read and write and can therefore contribute constructively to national issues because, they understand the economy and can therefore contribute constructively to decision-making of their country.\n\n\
6. Advancement in technology: In a buoyant economy there is an increase in the level of knowledge and expertise of science and technology to solving problems in the fields of health, industry, agriculture, communication etc. Through science and technology women who never thought of giving birth because of blocked fallopian tubes or women who have been declared barren can now have babies through in- vitro fertilization. In- vitro fertilization is a method which involves implanting fertilized eggs inside a womanâ€™s womb to be nurtured by the woman for a normal pregnancy and birth to occur. Again, science and technology has made it possible for men with low sperm count or weak sperms to have their own children through artificial insemination. Treatment with drugs can help men with low sperm count to improve their sperm count to be able to impregnate a woman and have children.\n\n\
7. In a buoyant economy there is low population growth rate but they also keep or ensure optimum population to promote economic development that enables the state to provide the required amenities such as education, housing and health delivery.\n\n\
8. In a buoyant economy there is reduction in poverty as a result of available job avenues for creating wealth. Citizens in a buoyant economy enjoy a high standard of living since jobs are available and therefore many people are above the poverty line and can save part of their incomes at the banks from which industrialists and businessmen can borrow and invest in setting up factories, banks, communication firms etc. As more industries are established more people are employed who earn more income to enable more wealth to be created.\n\n\
9. Positive work attitudes and high national productivity. In a buoyant economy workers exhibit high sense of duty and therefore punctuality and regularity are very high at the work place. Workers report at work on time, keep attendance frequently and remain at post until closing time. Workers therefore put in enough effort to meet set targets and increase productivity.\n\n\
10. Increase in savings and investments: In a buoyant economy industrial output is very high as a result many people are employed to produce such output. From the incomes workers receive they can save part at the banks to enable businessmen to borrow and invest in new enterprises or expand existing ones which will create more employment for people.\n\n\
11. Peace and stability attracts foreign investors. Political stability is essential for the economic and social development of every country. In a buoyant economy inter-state warfare, civil strife, ethnic conflict, inter-tribal wars etc. are absent and therefore there is peace and order, which allows production to go on uninterrupted.\n\n\
12. Economy is export driven: In a buoyant economy there is a healthy growth in sectors of the economy which allows for high productivity. Since the economy is highly industrialized and agriculture is also highly mechanized output is so high that greater percentage of what is produced is exported to earn foreign exchange for the nation. The high industrialized nations like Japan, Germany, U.S.A etc. export their excess products to less developed countries since our local industries cannot even produce to feed the local people.\n\n\
13. High rate of industrialization: In a buoyant economy the rate of industrialization is very high since capital intensive methods are used in production. For example, robots are used in the manufacture of cars or in performing complex activities. Almost all sectors of the economy are highly mechanized which lead to increase in output and a reduction in the cost of production. In the printing of books complex machines are used which enable large volumes of books to be printed within a short period of time."
