question: "1b. In what four ways can the roles of traditional rulers help unify their subjects.",
options: "\
1. Traditional rulers are a link between the living and the dead. The living regards chiefs as the representative of the ancestors and obeys them accordingly. It is therefore through the chief that the people can communicate with the ancestors by pouring libation and making sacrifices to the ancestors on behalf of the people. Chiefs therefore bridge the gap between the living and the ancestors and the other spirit powers on special occasions such as festival days like Adae among the Akans, Homowo among the Gas, Ahoba among the Gomoa, etc.\n\n\
2. Traditional rulers preside over festivals and are very pivoted during these moments and the people revolve around them. Chiefs fix dates for traditional festivals and supervise the organisation of the festival. He also offers sacrifices as a thank offering to the traditional deities and ancestral spirits for the previous year’s guidance and also asks for blessing and protection in their undertaking in the coming year through the pouring of libation. Stools and regalia are washed with white /red day. Festivals are a period the chief renews his vows to the ancestors and also a period to remember the dead. The organization of festivals by traditional rulers brings all the people together to celebrate the event. This ensures the union of the families in the society.\n\n\
3. Traditional rulers are custodians of the societal norms and values. Chiefs ensure that norms like taboos are adhered to by the people. People who break the customs of the community are brought to the chief for the necessary purification rites to be performed. For example, it is against our customary practices for young people to insult the elderly. Again, among the Asantes. “it is a taboo to go to farm an Akwase Dae. The chief as a custodian of societal values like bride wealth, patrilineal inheritance, respect for the aged, love of neighbours, puberty rites, rites of passage etc. help to bind the people together.\n\n\
4. Traditional rulers are representatives of their people. They deal with national and international dignitaries on behalf of their people. When government officials visit towns and villages they call on the ruler of that area to pay homage and explain their mission and government policies to the chief. Rulers receive international dignitaries like Ambassadors and High Commissions on behalf of the people. Sometimes durbars are held in honour of such dignitaries for development projects they had done for the people.\n\n\
5. Traditional rulers are symbols of protection for the people both physically and spiritually. The chief is traditionally the political leader of his people. Together with the council of elders, he carries out the day to day affairs of his people and also rallies his subjects behind the to defend stool lands and properties held in their trust. Again traditionally, chiefs are regarded as the Commander-in-chief of the state and therefore organize his men to defend the community in times of either internal or spiritual leader, intercedes for the people when they offend the gods. He also performs sacrifices and pours libation at events to unify the people and the gods.\n\n\
6. Traditional rulers by virtue of their position symbolize unity among the people. The chief mobilizes his people to undertake communal labour to clean the community. As a social, religious and political leader of his people, the chief commands the respect of the people and mobilizes them to undertake self- help and community projects like building a community centre,clinic,KVIP, etc. By bringing the people together to undertake such projects the ruler is able to unify the people for more community projects and words of commendation from him also encourage the community to always work as one people\n\n\
7. Traditional rulers function as peace makers during settlement of disputes between and among subjects. Traditional rulers therefore unite the people by acting as arbitrators’, that is, settling disputes. When there is dispute between ‘two people or matters relating to land disputes between two families the chief will summon his council of elders and settle the case so that there will be peace between the families. lf there are disturbances between family heads which will create confusion in the town it’s the duty of the chief acting on the advice of his council of elders to see to the amicable settlement of the case. In judging cases, traditional rulers try to be impartial so that peace will prevail between the members of the family. As the head of the traditional court, the chief has the final say in the decision making process that is aimed at-bringing about peace to the community.\n\n\
8. Traditional rulers ensure the preservation of the cultural heritage of the community. Festivals, drumming and dancing, chieftaincy, singing etc are elements of cultural practices that bind the people together. During festivals, the chief symbolizes the culture and tradition of his people: The chief is a liaison between the living and the dead. As such he pours libation to the gods and the spirits of the-dead for their blessings, guidance and protection and also offers sacrifices as a thank-offering to the traditional deities and ancestral spirits."

id: "question2b",
question: "2b. Describe four roles of the individual in community development.",
options: "\
1. Participate in community-initiated projects: The individual can express his support for his community by engaging in community initiated projects like the establishment of community library, clinic, football park, school, etc. Here the individual takes part in the self-help project because he is patriotic and therefore receives no money in return.\n\n\
2. Adoption of positive attitude: The individual must lead an exemplary life in the community for the youth to follow. He must be courteous to the elderly and assist them where necessary. The individual must be loyal and law abiding and eschew self-interest. An individual who is loyal will stand up against acts which will disturb the stability of the community.\n\n\
3. The individual must try to find out problems of the community and mobilize available resources for solving them: Some of the problems that are common in the community include the effects and prevention of AIDS, teenage pregnancy, poor academic performance of the youth, drug and child abuse. The individual must seek the assistance of the District Chief Executive for personnel and logistics to enable him carry out such assignment. He must contact friends who are dedicated to is /her cause and engage them to offer assistance in the area where they are knowledgeable. By taking part in these activities the individual will be contributing in his own way by controlling the spread of HIV/ AIDS and the effects of drug abuse, homosexuality, lesbianism etc. in the country\n\n\
4. The individual must involve him/herself in communal labour: Here the individual is obliged to take part in communal labour activities in the community in which he/she resides. He can help in clearing chocked gutters and weedy areas etc. This will promote healthy and clean environment devoid of mosquitoes. For communal labour if the individual does not attend he can be sanctioned•\n\n\
5. Payment of levies and taxes for community development: Taxes and levies that individuals’ development pay as members in the community are used by. District/Metropolitan Assemblies to finance development projects like constructing schools, feeder roads, market, clinics, hospitals etc for the people. It is therefore obligatory for the individual in the community to pay his /her levies and taxes. The individual can be sent to count if he fails to honour this national duty.\n\n\
6. The capable individuals can contribute money, equipment to community work: There are some wealthy individuals who volunteer to build community centres’ or schools or clinics for their locality. Other well meaning people too can donate items like shovels, roofing sheets, sewing machines and books for their; community schools. These contributions will help needy communities to acquire schools, books, community centre, etc. which would have taken many years to provide them. 7. Individuals must obey rules to ensure peace, and harmony in community: The individual is expected to abide by the rules and regulations in the community. This will promote peaceful co- existence and harmony in the community. The individual must respect the views of other people and must not react irrationally since such a behaviour can lead to conflict and disturb the peace of the community.\n\n\
8. The individual must have initiative: The individual can form pressure groups like community watch- dog committees to rid the community-of criminals who terrorize the community at night. Again, community vigilantes can also destroy the hideouts of wee smokers and other drug addicts. Also the individual must report to the police the hideouts of criminals. This will ensure that people in the community do not live in fear but are protected and can go about their normal duties without harboring any fear of attack."

question: "3b. Mention the advantages of a well-timed marriage",
definition: "A well-timed marriage is beneficial to the individual in many ways:",
options: "\
1. A well-timed marriage allows prospective couple time to study each other: During courtship the would-be-couple study each other to enable them decide on whether each possesses the acceptable qualities which will enable them to live together as husband and wife. The character or conduct of the couple is very important since they would want to associate with someone who is respectful, polite in speech, tolerant, humble, obedient, considerate, etc. These, qualities would enable the couple to know that a well-timed marriage is built-on mutual love and understanding.\n\n\
2. A well-timed marriage is beneficial to the individual because the couple is often financially and socially prepared for the marriage. The man and woman who are planning to get marrie9 must be self- supporting, that is, they must be gainfully employed or self-employed. This will help them to earn an income which will enable them to purchase the things they will need before they marry. Again, if the couples are working before marrying this will help them to rent their own apartment so that they do not become a burden on their parents.\n\n\
3. A well- timed marriage has the potential of enduring. In, a well time marriage divorce is rare. This is due to the many years spent studying each other. The weakness.es and capabilities of the couples may be known during the days of courtship. Since couples can correct any problems or weaknesses during courtship period this will enable them to live together as husband and wife for a very long time and also makes the marriage stable and durable.\n\n\
4. A well-timed marriage is beneficial to, the individual because the couple is given community recognition and respect .Marriage accords the couple the social recognition, respect and prestige which are associated with marriage. A negative stigma is put on anyone who is of age but is not married. It provides adult status and social acceptance to the couple and anyone who is not married is recognized as immature and therefo.re would not be assigned adult responsibility. parents for social and economic security. Children from well-timed marriage are therefore properly cared for since couples space their childbirth to enable them have manageable numbers of children they can adequately cater for. The children acquire the best of education simply because in a well-timed marriage few children are raised and so they can be catered for properly. By so doing the future of the children become well secure and responsible members of the society.\n\n\
6. A well-timed marriage makes the couple psychologically and emotionally prepared to face the challenges of marriage. Couples who go through marriage counseling are guided to know the do’s and don’ts in marriage which enable them to face the challenges of marriage. Since couples are likely to go through psychological and emotional trauma associated ‘with marriage, marriage counseling helps to hold the marriage together and from any unexpected problems that couples are likely to face as they travel the marriage road."

{
id: "question4b",
question: "4b. Discuss four benefits Ghana derives from practicing democratic governance",
definition: "The following are some of the benefits Ghana derives from practicing democratic governance.",
options: "\
1. Democratic governance ensures free interaction of ideas and opinions that can help in taking informal decisions in the public interest. There is free expression of ideas and views of critical issues. This atmosphere of free expression enables the citizens of the country to exchange ideas freely and offer constructive criticisms and suggestions in as much as what people say and write cut across the whole population.\n\n\
2. Democratic governance ensures political stability: Under this system of government there is fair operation of the electoral system, regular free and fair elections, impartial electoral commission to conduct and supervise elections. As a result, a group of people who plan coup d’etat to overthrow the government cannot work since the people are deeply involved in the governance of the country. The people of the country are those who have voted the government into power and it is the same people who have the power to either retain the government or vote it out of power.\n\n\
3. Democratic governance ensures rule of law: This means that there must be equality before the law and therefore people cannot take the law into their hands and do whatever they like. Democratic governance, therefore, prevents arbitrary use of the law in favour of one group of people at the expense of the other. Judges must therefore interpret the law of the lands according to the constitution. This therefore prevents the government to be dictator because there are checks and balances. For example, the police personnel cannot just go to someone’s house and arrest or take somebody’s property with the reason that he has the power to do whatever he or she wants to.\n\n\
4. Democracy governance ensures sustained development Democracy ensures that power is transferred from one government to another through a term of office, which in Ghana takes a duration of four years. This transfer is expected to have a smooth and peaceful electoral transition without resorting to violence. With peace and stability foreign investors come to the country to invest in economic and job creating ventures for growth and development. The government’s attention on promotion of agricultural and industrial enterprises as well as social facilities like hospitals, schools, housing, water and electricity for the people is also strengthened. Employers, farmers, workers and individuals exploit the peaceful political atmosphere to exercise their rights and responsibilities to enhance the growth and development of the country.\n\n\
5. Democracy governance ensures safe investment destination: The peace and tranquility that Ghana is enjoying ensures political and economic stability of the country. As a result foreign investors have found Ghana a safe place to invest their surplus capital. Many foreign investors both private and government have invested in the banking system, mining, manufacturing, etc. Ghana also receives loans and grants from multinational donors like the World Bank and IMF because of relatively peace and political stability the country is enjoying. No foreign investor will invest in a country where there is constant coup d’etat, political rivalry, civil strife etc.\n\n\
6. Ghana has enjoyed international recognition: Ghana receives a lot of foreign presidents and dignitaries from foreign countries because there is democratic governance and the operation of the rule of law. Ghana is respected in, international circles because of the successful operation of democratic governance destination of many heads in the country which has made her the preferred of states and governments.\n\n\
7. Democratic governance ensures peaceful change of governments: Under democratic check on the ruling is relative government peace and stability because of the presence of opposition who act as governance, therefore, for arbitrary use of power and dictatorship. Democratic governance, therefore, ensure that power is transferred from one government through a term of office, which to another to have a smooth and peaceful in Ghana takes duration of four years. This transfer is expected -electoral transition without resorting to violence."

question: "5. Discuss five challenges the family faces in its role of socializing the child.",
definition: "The following are some of the challenges the family faces in its role of socializing the child",
options: "\
1. Limited time for children the child due to economic activities: Parents have limited time for their children working to economic day in the activities offices they or selling perform outside the home. Parents in the urban centres spend most of unable at the market in the night. Even after close of work they are to reach home early due to traffic jam and sometimes they have to attend church meetings and programmes. The absence of parents from home due to demands of work means that the child is left in the hands of the house-help and creches. The parents may reach home late in the night when the child is asleep and may have no contact with the child. Both Parents and children also leave home early without the parents having enough time to teach them their values and norms. This explains why parents do not have enough time to socialize their children to an appreciable level.\n\n\
2. Influence of foreign religion: Religious organizations may also pose a threat to the family in its efforts to transmit the cultural values of the society to the youth. The influence of religion has become so powerful doctrines. Parents find that whatever value transmitted by parents can be reversed by religious it difficult inculcating cultural values in the youth. Many youth have been practices taught by involve their churches pouring that festivals, chieftaincy, puberty rites etc. are fetish since some of their libation, slaughtering animals or fowls etc. Parents therefore find it difficult correcting the bad impression foreign religion has on our culture.\n\n\
3. Negative peer influence: Negative peer influence undermines efforts of parents. This is because peers usually have their own values and rules of behavior, which may differ radically from those of the family. A peer group can influence the behavior of the youth thus making it difficult for the values of the family to be transmitted to the youth. They may teach the child bad habits like smoking, drinking, stealing, boy- girl relationship etc.\n\n\
6. Influence of formal Education: Formal education competes with the family in giving primary socialization to the child- e.g. in the picking of language. The school places more emphasis on knowledge acquisition to the neglect of the development of values and attitudes. This has negative repercussions on the well-being of the individual since it does not help the youth to fit into society. The school system is such that even during holidays when the child has to stay at home and perform household chores he/she attends extra classes till school re-opens. The family therefore has very little time to teach the child cooking, washing, and other home activities. Many children prefer to greet in english than to do so in the Ghanaian local language."

question: "6b. Describe four ways in which formal education can be made to have positive effects on the Ghanaian society",
definition: "The following are some of the ways formal education can be made to have positive effects on the Ghanaian society.",
options: "\
1. Formal education must be structured to equip the recipients with both knowledge and practical skills: Formal education must train the youth in the acquisition of knowledge and the acquisition of skills. This will help to prepare the individual to function effectively in his /her future Work place. The establishment of trade centres and vocational institutions give skills to the youth so that they can be employed or establish their own businesses.\n\n\
2. Formal education must be structured to serve the needs of society: Formal education should make people knoe their civic responsibility by keeping their surrounding clean, not littering the streets with papers,polythene bags, etc. This will rid the society of filth and make the country environmentally friendly to live in since a clean environment affects the health of the people.\n\n\
3. Formal education must be made to promote character building. Formal education in the Ghanaian society has enabled citizens to behave responsibly. This is due to the teaching of moral and religious education in schools. As a result, children have been able to acquire sound moral upbringing so that they grow up to be socially acceptable standards and can differentiate between good and bad. In this way, the youth of the Ghanaian society can grow up to become good leaders who can fit any position entrusted to them.\n\n\
4. Formal education must be structured to enable the Ghanaian become conscious of his/her identity. Formal education must bring togetherness among ethnic groups in Ghana even though we come from different ethnic group we are one people with one destiny. As a result we must consider ourselves as one nation but as individuals coming from different communities or towns who speak different languages. As Ghanaians we must identify ourselves more with our nation, Ghana, and reduce the ethnic sentiments that we have as individual Ghanaians and know that Ghana stands supreme over our individual interests. This has helped to prevent tribalism among the people in the country.\n\n\
5. Formal education in Ghana must be made to promote Ghanaian cultural values through the teaching of social studies in our Junior and Senior High Schools are taught the Ghanaian cultural values. The youth are taught the festival of the various ethnic groups of Ghana and also the dressing, language, dance of the people. The culture of the people is therefore transmitted, from one generation to another. Ghanaian cultural values also help to shape the behavior of the youth. Examples of such values are honesty, sense of time, respect for aged, sense of regret, etc. All these are moral values help the youth to behave decently toward one another.\n\n\
6. Formal education must be structured to ensure the development of appropriate technology. Our education must give the appropriate attention to science and technology to transform the economy into a middle income economy. The acquisition of science and technology increases the individual’s capacity to produce equipments and tools that are appropriate to the Ghanaian economy. For example, the development of appropriate technology should help us to build house with local materials at affordable prices for many people to buy. Again we should also use appropriate or simple technology to process local foodstuffs and preserve them for sale.\n\n\
7. Migration: Migration of the youth to urban centers in search of jobs I schools etc. is a challenge the family faces in its role of socializing the child. When a child migrates from a rural area to an urban centre like Accra, Kumasi Cape Coast etc., he will immediately notice that the norms of his new environment is quite different from his rural area. As the child is in a new environment he will abandon the rich values he has acquired from his parents and adopt those of friends or the new people he is staying with. The child is then tom between two cultures, that is, the norms and values of his parents and that of the urban centre. His desire to get a job may not materialize and may therefore become a street child. If he is likely to get a school to attend he will adopt the lifestyle of the children in the urban centre and will therefore find it difficult to continue to adopt the norms and values of his family."

{
id: "question7b",
question: "7b. Explain four factors that account for the low patronage of family planning practices in Ghana.",
definition: "The following are some of the factors that account for the low patronage of family planning practices in Ghana.",
options: "\
1. Ineffective family planning education: The low patronage of family planning practices in Ghana may be due to poor family planning education that is being carried out. Many Ghanaians have low level of education thus affecting their ability to follow family planning practices. Most of the billboards which show pictures of how family planning pills are taking are usually found in the urban centres. Radio jingles and TV adverts about family planning practices are very few and so not many people listen to Radio jingles or see the TV adverts. As a result only-few people who are educated or can read and listen to the news have knowledge about family planning methods.\n\n\
2. Inadequate functional literacy programmes on family planning: The functional literacy programmes on family planning do not reach the rural areas where the bulk of the population resides. Most of the billboards on family planning can be found in the urban centres to the neglect of the rural areas. The rural community is mostly illiterate and cannot read family planning band bills or understand family planning practices without interpretation. There are low education programmes to create awareness in the society. There family planning centres are all located in the urban centres leaving the rural areas unattended. Family planning personnel hardly visit the rural areas where the bulk of the population resides.\n\n\
3. The honor and respect associated with having more children: -The desire among some men to have a large family also influences them to have a large number of children. Illiterate parents think that the number o f children g1ven birth by a woman determines her womanhood. Among the Akans a man who can have ten children with his wife is rewarded with a gift (a sheep) literally called “badudwan”. With this reward many men and women want to prove their reproductive capacity by also many children. Again men who can have many children are regarded-wealthy and respected in the society. Also having many children is seen as a social prestige.\n\n\
4. The fear of side effects on the health of the users of family planning methods: Some people have some misconception about family planning measures. For example, some people believe the use of family planning pills, foams, spermicides, diaphragmeti will make them barren or impotent.\n\n\
5. The disapproval of family planning practices by some religious groups: Some religious organizations, like the Catholic Church, do not encourage their members to use family pills. They believe artificial contraception-is against the will of God. The Catholics -regard all forms of contraception (part from the rhythm method) as sinful. Muslims also criticize it as it is against their religion.\n\n\
6. Safeguard against infant mortality: In some traditional communities where many people are illiterate or have very low level of education such people tend to give birth to many children thinking that when some die as a result of childhood diseases some will live. Such attitudes tend to account for the low patronage of family planning practices in Ghana.\n\n\
7. Large numbers of children considered as economic assets. In the Ghanaian culture a large family enhances one’s status, economic assets, respect, etc People also regard many children as economic assets especially in times of old age, which means more children is more future prosperity. In the rural areas men married many wives so that they can use them as labour on the farms."

question: "8. Explain five problems that affect the operations of the African Union.",
definition: "The problems that affect the operations of the African Union are as follows:",
options: "\
1. Conflicts between and among nations: All member states are divided on deological lines. Some African leaders are socialist whereas others are capitalist. Such political divisions do not augur well for unity. Such political divisions breed hatred, suspicion and conflicts among the member states. It also affects consensus building when it comes to decision-making.\n\n\
2. Inter-state boarder disputes: Attempts by the AU to settle disputes among members threaten the unity of the African Union. The boarder disputes between Ethiopia and Eritrea, Cameroon and Nigeria over the oil rich Boleassa peninsular are examples that the AU has to grapple with.\n\n\
3. Financial problems or constraints: Some members of the African Union are economically weak. They are saddled with external debts, balance of payment problems, poverty, problems of economic development. In view of these difficulties, some member countries are unable to pay their membership dues which affect the operations of the Union.\n\n\
4. Lack of standing army: One of the aims of the African Union is to promote defense and security within the continent. However, because there is no standing army there is a bit of difficulty in dispatching soldiers to war tom areas as member counties feel reluctant to release soldiers from their national army to undertake continental assignments. In the absence of a standing army, the AU may find 1tdifficult to effectively ensure that its policies and objectives are complied with.\n\n\
5. Internal political instability in member countries: Frequent change of government in a number of African Countries due to frequent coup d’etat usually affects the work of the AU. These frequent political instability e.g. coups, civil strife or wars ethnic conflicts etc. on the continent makes the AU ineffective in taking decisions necessary for the development of the continent. Some African leaders are power drunk who do want to relinquish power open when there is discontent in the country over their misrule. The result may be a military take-over. These violent changes in governments create a serious problem of refuges in neighboring countries.\n\n\
6. Mistrust / suspicion among political leaders of Africa : There is lack of unity due to mistrust among member states, which usually leads to disputes between some of the member states. There is increasing mistrust among member countries due to differences in political ideologies, increasing border disputes and the fact that some countries help political exiles and dissidents to overthrow the governments’ of the countries.\n\n\
7. Foreign influence / Colonial Legacy: Influences of external powers ort member countries affect the operations of the AU. Some of the AU member states refuse to detach themselves from their colonial masters because of certain benefits they gain from the colonial masters. Hence, certain decisions, important and crucial ones, that have to be taken, but because the decisions might affect their colonial masters in a rather negative way, they refuse to implement the decisions o f the African Union."

options: "\
1. Lateness: Many workers especially in Ghana go to work late and leave the work place earlier than closing time and do not see anything wrong with this. Workers who behave in this way donothaverespectfortimeandtheresultofthisbehaviouristhelossoftimeorlossofmanhoursof work and inability to achieve set targets. The result is lowering of labour productivity.\n\n\
2. Laziness: Many workers instead of devoting working hours to work, workers loiter around, receive visitors, work out lotto and gossip. The reality is that many workers do not work hard when there is little supervision. The effect of this attitude is that workers tend to produce shoddy work to make up for lost time. Another effect is that the producer cannot meet dead line set for the market\n\n\
3. Dishonest /Insecurity: Bribery and corruption are common practices at work places. In most cases one often has to give out money for his work done otherwise the work is unnecessarily delayed. Sometimes an outright demand is made for a specific amount to have somebody else’s work done or put aside. This act of giving and receiving bribe is so much entrenched in the Ghanaian social fabric that work without an offer of bribe is not given the due attention it deserves. This has the effect of reducing the productivity of the business The result of such behavior is that workers are unable to give the true reflection of things in the organization and this can lead to fall in the organization and lead to fall in standard of work of poor quality of work done. Financial dishonesty is like the collection of “kick-back” or falsification of accounts of accounts will lead to the denial of the organization of needed capital for expansion and diversion of business resources.\n\n\
4. Lack of planning: A business which does not have laid down plans for its workers will not achieve its target The effect on output will be misuse of resources leading to a fall in output and increase in cost of production. It will also lead to lack of focus, thereby making work done in haphazard manner resulting in increase in cost of production.\n\n\
5. Uncooperative attitude: This negative behavior can cause the organization to be denied of fine ideas which will prevent the -business from growing, In an organization where workers quarrel among themselves and do not work together as a team ‘can cause the sabotage of the organizational• goals of the business.\n\n\
6. Arrogance / Disrespect: Disrespectful workers may not be prepared to carry out orders from their supervisors. Workers therefore become incorrigible and flout directives of their superiors. Such an attitude has the effect of lowering the morale of workers and makes them refuse to learn new skills leading to non-development of the organization."

options: "\
1. Nepotism: In some work places employers employ their relatives who do not have the requisitequalificationstohandlecemiinpositionsbutaremadetobethere. Such relations naturally become informants to the employers and seldom face any disciplinary action since it becomes difficult to enforce discipline among relative, tribesmen, friends and favourites. When this happens discipline breaks down, workers misbehave and productivity declines.\n\n\
2. Lack of motivation: Lack of incentives do not encourage commitment to hard work. Most employers do not encourage their workers to work hard through incentive packages, workers therefore feel that their efforts put in the performance of assigned duties are not recognized. Incentives to motivate workers to work harder may include such things such as adequate allowances, free medical care, free transport to and from work, free lunch, promotions, long service and annual awards for outstanding performance.\n\n\
3. Corruption: Bribery and corruption are common practices at work places. In most cases one often has to give out money for his work done otherwise the work is unnecessarily delayed. Sometimes an outright demand is made for a specific amount to have somebody else’s work done or put aside. This act of giving and receiving bribe is so much entrenched in the Ghanaian social fabric that work without an offer of bribe is not given the due attention it deserves. This has the effect of reducing the productivity of the business.\n\n\
4. Poor management / supervision: Many state enterprises have unplanned expansion and this leads to dis-economies of scale. For example, more planning and organization is required for the state enterprise as it expands, since the administration may be difficult to handle because of its size. Workers may be poorly supervised. Some workers may absent themselves from work or come to work late due to poor management and supervision.\n\n\
5. Government pricing policies may not be cost effective: The Government pricing policies for certain goods and services produced by it like water, electricity, Health, education, etc. often times do not take into consideration costs of production. Since the public corporations are not profit oriented and produce at higher cost there is the tendency for such enterprises to fail because their pricing policies are not cost effective, that is, their pricing policies cannot adequately cater for cost of production and other expenses.\n\n\
6. Government /political influence: The government sometimes interferes with employment of workers in public corporation. This may lead to less competent people placed at certain positions, i.e. putting square pegs into round holes.\n\n\
7. Inadequate capital: Since the government owns state enterprises the inability of government to provide the required funds tends to make the state enterprise to fail. For example, many corporations cannot purchase new machines and spare parts and have to depend on the old ones which cannot operate well because of high cost of spare parts and operational cost.\n\n\
8. Over reliance on government subvention: Due to the fact that state enterprises depend on subvention to meet expenses, there is no incentive to efficiency. Waste is very rampant in public enterprises because it is the government, which bears the losses.\n\n\
7. Poor attitude to work: This is due to lack of self-interest and poor attitude to government property. Many workers have an erroneous belief that if they put in more effort the extra profit goes to benefit the government and not the workers. Many workers go to work late or gossip at work, or wok lotto, or sleep during working hours. This behaviour leads to loss of time or loss of man hours of work and inability to achieve set targets. The result is lowering of labour productivity.\n\n\
9. Financial Mismanagement: Many top officials of state enterprises have over the years embezzled funds of state enterprises while workers indulge in pilfering state property. There is also the problem of misapplication of funds, ie. funds earmarked for a particular state enterprise may be diverted into unproductive use.\n\n\
10. Political instability: The frequent changes in the governments of West African countries as a result of frequent military coups make it difficult for state enterprises to function properly as their heads are frequently changed. There is therefore no continuity of work and panning of projects."
