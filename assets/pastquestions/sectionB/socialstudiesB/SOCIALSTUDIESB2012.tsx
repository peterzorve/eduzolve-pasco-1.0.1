question: "1. Highlight five ways traditional festivals help to promote national development.",
options: "\
1. Fund raising for development projects / planning: Traditional festivals help to promote national development by raising funds for development projects / planning. Traditional chiefs use festivals to initiate developments like building classrooms, markets, places of convenience, electrification, etc. To finance these projects they use the occasion to ask the people present to contribute financially towards these projects. Sometimes, Telecommunication Companies like MTN, Airtel, Vodafone etc. and brewery companies such as Ghana Breweries and Guinness Ghana Limited sponsor the festivals. Again well-to-do members of the locality where the festival is organised sometimes donate generously towards community initiated projects.\n\n\
2. Opportunity is given to chiefs and government officials to explain government policies to the people: The chiefs use the occasion to talk or appeal directly to government officials such as Ministers, Members of Parliament, Municipal Chief Executives, District Chief Executives who have been invited to grace the occasion to provide them with social amenities like water, electricity, clinics, roads etc. Sometimes these government officials may give a promise as to the provision of one or two of the mentioned projects or tell the people that their requests would be carried to the appropriate quarters for consideration. Government ministers use the occasion to announce development projects and government policies to the people and to educate them on important issues affecting the people in the locality.\n\n\
3. Festivals offer opportunities for old relationships to be re-kindled and new ones established: Festivals now serve such important functions as periods of get-together. The life of the community is renewed, thus cementing their unity by bringing the people together e.g. through sporting activities, fun fairs etc. This is the time when people who work outside home return to establish reunion with their relations. It is a tune when children who are born outside their hometowns are brought home to meet their relations. People make new friends and new marriages are contracted.\n\n\
4. Generation of foreign exchange earnings from tourists: Festivals attract foreign tourist which help earn income for the Tourist Industry. Tourists who visit the country during festival celebrations bring in a lot of foreign money which they use to pay for hotel accommodation, the food they eat at restaurants, and hire transport and pay tour guides.\n\n\
5. Enhancement of local economies: Festivals promote trade activities among the local people through the selling of traditional cloths, sandals, stools, artefacts etc. Traders use the occasion to sell their goods to make profit. During traditional festivals there is a boom in the trade of traditional cultural items mentioned above. Again, people use the occasion to set up food joints near the festival grounds to attract people. Concert and other traditional activities are organised at popular places in the locality to earn some money.\n\n\
6. Entertainment and Advertisements in the Public Media: Traditional festivals offer opportunity for organisers of the festival to advertise the activities and programmes in the national and private electronic and print media. This will enable a lot of people both outside and inside Ghana know how to plan to take part in the entertainment activities of the festival celebration. The public media through adverts and other promotion activities help to sell the rich cultural heritage to people outside Ghana.\n\n\
7. Settlement of disputes: Festivals offer opportunity for age - long disputes to be settled through mediation and reconciliation among family members which help to promote social stability. It means that people who may have been in some form of conflict or misunderstanding during the year seek peaceful settlement and reconciliation during this period. Such occasions are also used to settle family and clan disputes and the gods are pacified for the peaceful settlement.\n\n\
8. Festival promotes tourism: This is a period of cultural revival as it attracts people from other countries to witness and appreciate the cultural heritage of the country.- It also offers tourists the opportunity to appreciate the rich cultural diversity that exists in Ghana. When tourist visit Ghana to witness our festivals they also visit places of interest the Kakum National Park, the Castles etc."

question: "2b. Give four reasons why female genital mutilation should be abolished.",
definition: "The following are some of the reasons why female genital mutilation should be abolished.",
options: "\
1. Female genital mutilation (FGM) is a health hazard. The use of unsterilized instruments during the process of removing the girlâ€™s clitoris may lead to infection resulting in urinary tract infection, excessive bleeding, painful menstrual periods and injury to their adjacent organs, tetanus, infertility, AIDS etc. In some serious bases, the girl may bleed so excessively that she may die through loss of blood. Also, the various herbs used to stop the bleeding and heal the wounds after the operation do not save their efficiency and efficacy proven and if the girl is unfortunate, the bleeding would be so intense that she can lose her life.\n\n\
2. Female genital mutilation should be abolished because there is loss of sexual sensitivity. It denies the girl sexual pleasure, enjoyment and satisfaction when she later marries. This is because when the most sensitive part of the female sexual organ called the clitoris is cut off it denies the woman the sexual enjoyment she can derive from sexual act/intercourse with her husband. The woman may get bored with the act of sex and this can easily lead to problems in the marriage.\n\n\
3. Another reason for abolishing female genital mutilation is that it results in difficulty in childbirth. Those who undergo the rite, experience pains and difficulties in the course of giving birth. The operation affects smooth delivery of the new born child because it brings about complications when the woman is giving birth. After the wound has healed it leaves a scar, which closes genitalia making difficult for the woman to give birth smoothly. The difficulty of giving can sometimes result in the death of the woman\n\n\
4. Female genital mutilation (FGM) is barbaric because society frowns on it because of the many problems associated with it. Some of these problems include menstrual pains, persistent pelvic pain, vulva abscess, and large cysts requiring surgical removal. Societies, which practice female circumcision, are frowned at. People regard societies which practice this rite as backward and uncivilized.\n\n\
5. Female genital mutilation is a painful process since the operation involves no use of anaesthesia. The agonising pain that the girl goes through involves the cutting off the clitoris, or the labia minora (the inner lips) and the labia majora (the outer lips) with crude instruments. The bleeding that comes after the operation may be so intense that the girl can lose her life.\n\n\
6. Female mutilation is a violation of the child's right. It is demeaning and insulting to the integrity of womanhood. Girls who undergo it do not do so willingly. In fact, they have no choice to say no. Girls who refuses to do it are ostracized from the community and called by insulting names. In fact, female genital mutilation has been condemned by the convention on the rights of the child.\n\n\
7. Psychological effects: The thought of undergoing this painful process could lead to stress, fear and psychiatry problems on the part of the victim. There may be guilt, shame and depression on the part of the woman who may come from a different tribe where such a custom is not known or practised. Finally, female genital mutilation cannot be Justified on any biological or medical grounds, no matter the cultural justification."

question: "3. In what five ways can parent-child conflicts be prevented in the Ghanaian Society?",
options: "\
1. Child showing gratitude to parents/ guardians: Unfortunately, some children fail to show gratitude to their parents/ guardians for the sacrifices they have made towards their upbringing and education. The child should show gratitude to parents and guardians for giving them shelter, food, clothing, paying school fees, paying their medical bill etc. Children can show gratitude to their parents and guardians by giving them cards during their birthdays and special anniversaries.\n\n\
2. The child should be polite and courteous to his parents to prevent parent-child conflict. The child should not use insulting or abusing words in replying to any remarks the parents guardian may make about his/her behaviour. The child should take it in good faith and rather amend his or her bad ways to earn the respect of his parent / guardian. The child should learn to say thank you' at any time he is given something. He should also learn to greet his parents I guardians.\n\n\
3. The child should use resources judiciously: As a child you must use resources like pocket money wisely. This means that you must use the little pocket money given you for the purpose it was meant for. You must not use your pocket money meant for food on sweets or anything that cannot be useful to you. Some children. can save some of their pocket money to buy pen, eraser or story book.\n\n\
4. The child should co-operate with parents / guardians in performing household duties, it is very important that after school the child assists the parents m cooking, washing, and sweeping. This will go a long way to reduce the burden of household duties performed by our parents. By co-operating with your parents / guardians he/she will be encouraged to provide your needs.\n\n\
5. Seeking guidance and counselling to parents - child conflicts: Parents need to seek counselling on matters that bother on child's behaviour at school and at home. Adolescents need constant advice because they go through many changes as they grow.\n\n\
6. Parents must be firm and fair with children. Parents need to show interest in the lifestyle of their children or their children's behaviour. This offers the parent the chance to take corrective measures early in erring children. Parents must also adopt different ways when dealing with children. They should be firm and fair when handling the problems of the children. Parents also need to be tolerant, loving and caring.\n\n\
7. Parents must vary their approaches to their child's upbringing to suit the stages of the life cycle from infancy to adulthood. For example, parents must know that adolescence is characterized by a strong desire to be with the opposite sex. The boys may like to be with the girls and vice versa. The knowledge of boy-girl relationship will help the parent to teach the child sex education. Parents must let the child know that there is nothing wrong associating with a boy or a girl but this should not lead to having sex since this can make the girl pregnant and end her education.\n\n\
8. In promoting good child parent relationship parents should be seen to be concerned about the child's general welfare such as health, emotional, and physical needs. Parents should be concerned with the health needs of their children. They are to teach children to learn good health habits in order to reduce the risk of being infected with a disease by ensuring that their children are immunized against the six childhood diseases such as measles, polio, tuberculosis, whooping cough, diphtheria and tetanus. Provision of balanced diet for healthy body growth is the responsibility of parents. Good health therefore enables children to have and enjoy a better and improved quality of life. Provision of physical needs like food, shelter and clothing are the responsibilities of parents. Parents should therefore identify what a child needs at a particular point in time and take measures to provide them."

id: "question4",
question: "4. Highlight five factors that hinder the family from playing its role as an agency of socialization",
options: "\
1. Economic hardship hinder the family from playing its role as an agency of socialization the role of famines to socialize their children. Many parents are financially poor because they may not be earning enough from their economic activity to enable them take good care for their children. There are also situations where parents may be jobless but may feel just lazy to look for another work to do. In this situation parents may be unable to take proper care of their children. They cannot provide their basic needs and also pay their school fees. Children may become neglected and resort to drinking, drug abuse, prostitution, stealing etc.\n\n\
2. Children tend to learn new values of the urban centres that are likely to be different from those of the rural areas. It is difficult to pass on cultural values and even local languages to children who are out of the community with their parents to the urban centres. Cultural values are learnt and taught by seeing them in action. As a result children born in the urban centres come back home and cannot speak their local languages fluently. Some find it difficult to adjust into the rural area way of life.\n\n\
3. Influence of religion: Religious organizations may also pose a threat to the fly in its efforts to transmit the cultural values of the society to the youth. The influence of religion has become so powerful that whatever value transmitted by parents can be reversed by religious doctrines. Parents find it difficult inculcating cultural values in the youth. Many youth have been taught by their churches that festivals, chieftaincy etc. are fetish since some of their practices involve pouring libation, slaughtering animals or fowls etc. Parents therefore find it difficult correcting the bad impression foreign religion has on our culture.\n\n\
4. Demands of work take parents out of home: Parents have limited time for their children due to economic activities. Parents in the urban centres spend most of working day in the offices or selling at the market place. Even after close of work they are unable to reach home early due to traffic jam and sometimes they have to attend meetings. The absence of parents from home due to demands of work means that the child is left in the hands of the house-helps and creches. This explains why parents do not have enough time to socialise their children to an appreciable level.\n\n\
5. Urbanization: In the urban centres, parents do not stay with the extended family who serve as a check on the children. The extended family helps to prevent a family member from acts that can disgrace the whole family and assists in imparting the values of the society to the youth. In the urban centres the youth is exposed to all sorts of influences from magazines, television, pornographic films, discos, cinemas. thereby making it difficul.t for parents to enforce the values that have been transmitted to the youth.\n\n\
6. Negative Peer influence: Negative peer influence undermined efforts of parents. This is because peers usually have their own values and rules of behaviour, which may differ radically from those of the family. A peer group can influence the behaviour of the youth thus making it difficult for the values of the family to be transmitted to the youth. They may teach the child bad habits like smoking, drinking, stealing, boy- girl relationship etc.\n\n\
7. Influence of Formal Education: Formal education competes with the family in giving primary socialization to the child- e.g. in the picking of language. The school places more emphasis on knowledge acquisition to the neglect of the development of values and attitudes. This has negative repercussions on the well being of the individual since it does not help the youth to fit into society."

},


{
id: "question5b",
question: "5b. Examine four ways in which constitutional rule promotes national development.",
definition: "Constitutional rule promotes national development through the following ways:",
options: "\
1. Constitutional rule ensures sustainable development: Under Constitutional rule there is relative peace and stability because of the presence of opposition who acts as a check on the ruling government for arbitrary use of power and dictatorship. With peace and stability foreign investors come to the country to invest in economic and job creating ventures for growth and development. The government's attention on promotion of agricultural and industrial enterprises as well as social facilities like hospitals, schools, housing, water and electricity for the people is also strengthened. Employers., farmers, workers and individuals exploit the peaceful political atmosphere to exercise their rights and responsibilities to enhance the growth and development of the country.\n\n\
2. Constitutional rule discourages corruption / promotes accountability and transparency. Constitutional rule is also built on the principle of accountability. Accountability refers to a process by which those entrusted with political power are held responsible to the electorates for the exercise of their powers. A major means of achieving this principle of accountability is through frequent elections. The mass media and parliamentary question time, impeachment, motion of censure, etc are other means of ensuring that office holders exercise power with great caution.\n\n\
3. It discourages abuse of power / dictatorship: Constitutional rule ensures the absence of dictatorship. The government cannot be in power arbitrarily because the rules and regulations by which a democratic country is to be ruled are clearly stated in the constitution and for the governance of the country. Smee democratic government allows participatory democracy it prevents the ruling government from becoming dictatorial. The government cannot be in power arbitrarily because the rules and regulations by which a democratic country is to be ruled are clearly stated m the constitution and followed for governance. These are made possible because there are separation of powers and checks and balances between the organs and institutions of government. This means that the constitution makes it possible for power not to be concentrated in the hands of only one organ or institution of government.\n\n\
4. Ensures the protection of the rights of the people: Constitutional rule enables the individual to exercise his rights to secure for himself the fullest development of his personality and the enjoyment of life. These rights include freedom of speech, association, assembly, and worship, to do any lawful work and acquire property. These rights enable the individual to enjoy the social order and they are clearly stated in the constitution. Any attempt to interfere with the individual human rights either by the government or any other individual can be contested in court as unconstitutional.\n\n\
5. Ensures peaceful change of government: Constitutional rule ensures peaceful change of government through the ballot box and not through coup or through some disgruntled soldiers usurping power using guns. In constitutional rule opportunity exists for effecting a change of government through the ballot box. Political parties are allowed to exist and operate. In a democratic system of government, there should be a multi-party system and a healthy and peaceful competition for elections to choose or change governments. The masses should have the right and opportunity to elect their representatives to parliament from political parties of their choice. The elections should thus be free and fair according to the tenets of majority rule in a democratic state. The masses should accept the party with the higher number of votes as having won the elections. That means the right to vote. A multi-party system and regular elections avoid autocracy or dictatorship and make government efficient and responsible to the people.\n\n\
6. Constitutional rule promotes political stability: A peaceful and stable political climate facilitates national development. A country that is characterised by civil wars and coups cannot develop. Therefore political institutions like CHRAG, NCCE, etc. need to be strengthened in the country in order to help create stable political climate. To achieve this, constitutional rule must be allowed to work. People should also tolerate each other. Again, political leaders should be mindful of their utterances so that they do riot course in the country.\n\n\
7. Constitutional rule ensures respect from the international community. Under constitutional rule there is relative peace and stability because the opposition act as a check on the ruling government for arbitrary use of power and dictatorship. With peace and stability foreign investors come to the country to invest in economic and-Job creating ventures for grow and development. The government's attention on promotion of agricultural and industrial enterprises as well as social facilities like hospitals, schools, housing, water and electricity for the people also strengthened. Local investors are also encouraged to invest their capital in the country by setting up industries, shops and undertaking large- scale farms to produce food for the people."

question: "6. Describe five ways leaders can carry their followers along.",
definition: "The following are some of the ways leaders can carry their followers along.",
options: "\
1. A-leader must involve- followers-in decision making. Making a decision involves a choice from options. Thus a good leader should be able to make good choices which will benefit his followers. In making such decisions the leader should involve his followers- and accept their suggestions, contributions and ideas in arriving at decisions that will benefit the follows.\n\n\
2. Motivating followers: A leader should motivate his followers and inspire them for the realization of their objectives. A good leader must employ appropriate techniques to motivate members of the Â·group so that they work towards the achievement of the objectives of the group. A leader must motivate his followers through such techniques as praise, rewards, a pat on the back, promotions etc. which can encourage them to work hard towards the attainment of the goals of the group.\n\n\
3. Initiating and implementing policies: A leader can carry his followers along by formulating and implementing policies. The policies should aim at improving the life of the followers so that they will always be available when the leader needs their support. As a policy maker, a leader must be able to formulate policies and programmes which will promote the success of the organization. A leader must not undertake his activities with guess work but with proper practical ideas which will help the organization to function successfully.\n\n\
4. Tolerance: A leader should learn to be tolerant. This will enable him to accept any pain or fault that comes on his way. In order to get his followers along, he should not oppose other people's opinion and views as irrelevant. He should accept his followers views or ideas to be important and make them understand why some of their views or ideas cannot work when implemented. The leader should have good human relations so that he can accept all types of behaviour from his follower .\n\n\
5. Being courageous/ fair and firm/ able to apply rules and regulations: A leader must be fair and firm in dealing with his followers. He must not waver in his decision and actions.

6. Being a problem 'solver: A leader must be able to recognize the problems of his followers and provide solutions to them. He can do this by identifying the problem of the followers in terms of the assignment or situation they find themselves and develops plan of action to solve the problem.\n\n\
7. Organizing and co-ordinating / supervising / motivating: A leader must be able to co-ordinate the activities that are performed by his followers to ensure that affective decision is taken. A leader must also set up task and assign the tasks to his followers and make sure that each of the task assigned be performed to his satisfaction. This requires effective monitoring to achieve the desired results the leader wants."

question: "7b. Discuss four measures that Ghana can use to be self-reliant.",
definition: "The following are some of the measures that Ghana can use to be self-reliant.",
options: "\
1. Adoption of strategic medium/long term plan to minimize dependence on other countries: Ghana can be self reliant if she can diversify her agricultural sector so that she can reduce her dependence on foreign goods like electronics, alcoholic beverages, textile prints, sandals, shoes, tooth pick, cooking utensils etc. which can be produced locally. Ghana relies mostly on the export of cocoa beans as the major export crop and a major foreign exchange earner. When the revenue from our cocoa falls as a result of the fall in the price in the world market it affects the country's ability to finance her development projects since the foreign exchange from our cocoa export will not be enough to import machines, tractors, combine harvesters, equipment tools etc. the country needs. The government can set up agro- processing industries to process agricultural products like cocoa beans, into cocoa paste, cake, chocolate and cocoa butter for local use and for export. Ghana government can be self-reliant by reducing her depend enc e on foreign financial assistance since some foreign loans may be given to build places of convenience which may not be what the people need but rather the people want schools or clinics.\n\n\
2. Development of positive work attitudes / ethics: Citizens can demonstrate their dedication to duty and hard work to increase productivity. Workers must be given re-orientation on attitudes towards work by organising workshops andÂ· seminars for workers and managerial staff in time management and good work ethics. A worker should be punctual, regular, highly committed to his work. He should have respect for time and report early for work. He should not leave his work unattended to and walk aimlessly about. A worker with a high sense of duty shows concern, care and compassion in dealing with the business public. Goods and services are delivered on time to customers and with maximum amount of care.\n\n\
3. Development of human resources through education and training: . Human resource of Ghana can be improved through training. Through training one acquires the practical skills for a job. The trainee is taught practically the rudiments of the trad e or profession. Thus through training, one acquires knowledge, skills and attitude for a specific purpose or job. An individual needs to be trained by specialists in his chosen field to help him contribute effectively to national development. Someone who is interested in nursing can never become a professional nurse if he does not undergo training in a nursing school. Our natural resources can b e developed through research on utilization, provision of equipment for exploration and processing.\n\n\
4. Encouraging the consumption of made-in-Ghana goods: foreign cultural influences have affected the demand for locally made goods like food, leather works and clothes. There is therefore the need to reverse this trend. Th e youth most patronize locally produced goods as this will go a long way to increase demand for these goods and also help to improve the quality of the goods through suggestions and comments they make to producers. As more youth patronize locally made goods there will be an increase in demand for the goods and this will encourage producers to employ more youth to produce these goods for local us e and for export to earn more foreign exchange for the country's socio-economic development.\n\n\
6. Adopting modern technology and promoting research work: The adoption of modern technology such as mechanized farming where farmers use irrigation, combine harvesters, planters, ploughs, herbicides and fertilizers in farming help to increase agricultural yield for home supply and export to earn foreign exchange. The agricultural products such as cocoa, cotton, rubber. etc can also serve as raw materials for the local industries. The promotion of research work in farming can help to improve productivity. The establishment of agricultural research centres like Council for Scientific Research (CSIR) makes its rese arch findingsÂ· available for the nation. The CSIR has come out with new varieties of crops ( e.g. maize, cassava, yams, plantains and rice which have high yielding and disease / pest resistant / tolerant, with -high nutritional quality and requiring low inputs of fertilizers, herbicides. The release of these improved varieties and-their application technologies have contributed significantly to food security and-the national economy."

{
id: "question8b",
question: "8b. Outline four reasons for the establishment of the enterprises in Ghana.",
options: "\
1. To provide essential activities: The government participates in business to ensure efficient control and supervision of production and distribution of essential (or basic or strategic) goods and services. The provision of essential services like health, education, water, roads, railways, electricity, telephone, sanitation, etc. are considered valuable for the benefit of the community and unsuitable for operation by private interests. The reason is that if the provision of these services is left in the hands of private interests, they will charge high prices for the services provided and thus will bring about hardship to the public.\n\n\
2. For security and strategic reasons: To protect the security of t he state, industries connected with the manufacture of armaments (i.e. iron and steel industry) are protected by the government to ensure adequate supplies for military purposes. Some industries ( e.g. banking, mining, agriculture, iron and steel, chemicals and scientific instruments) are considered essential and important both to other industries and the economy and to enable them to survive the government controls their operation.\n\n\
3. Demand for huge capital establishment: To undertake activities ignored by private investors for various reasons like large capital requirement, low profitability or long gestation period governments undertake such activities. The government provides certain goods and services like water, electricity, roads, dams, bridges, harbours, etc., to ensure adequate supply or provision of capital and mechanization in these sectors; because their provision requiresÂ· heavy capital expenditure which would be too expensive for private investors to undertake. The Volta Dam Project in Ghana was financed with large amount of capital.\n\n\
4. National monopolies: The government establishes enterprises or participates in the production and distribution of goods and services where the nature of some goods makes it impossible for more than one firm to produce. For example, there is much economies of scale in the production and distribution of water, electricity, etc. by the government so that resources are not wasted.\n\n\
5. To eliminate monopoly enjoyed by private firms. To avoid the monopoly of the supply of certain goods and services by private interests, the government controls the enterprises that provide goods and services like electricity, water, telephone, banking, gas, health, and education because of the economic and social functions they perform. The government control of monopoly power prevents private investors (or enterprises) from charging higher prices for the goods and services they supply and a possible exploitation of consumers.\n\n\
6. Avoiding waste and duplication: The government participates in certain business enterprises to protect consumers from exploitation by business enterprises. The provision of water, health, education, etc., by the government enables consumers to enjoy a better service at reasonable prices. Competition among private enterprises providing, say, water and electricity to the same neighbourhood will lead to wasteful duplication of facilities and bring about chaos in laying pipes and cables.\n\n\
7. Adequacy of supplies of materials by government: The establishment of enterprises by government requires that such enterprises get adequate supply of materials needed to feed them. For example, the Electric ity Company of Ghana needs regular supply of materials like diesel, cables etc. for regular maintenance to ensure that supply of power ts not interrupted. In the same vein, the Ghana Water Company also require s chemicals to purify water supplied to the general public. The laying pipes to new service areas require materials which have to be imported and its only the government which can do that."

question: "9. Outline five sources of finance available to the private entrepreneur in Ghana",
options: "\
1. Personal savings: The sole proprietor can save for certain number of years with the hope of establishing a business of his/her own. When the sole proprietor has saved enough money he can start a business. From the self generated funds accumulated over the years,. the sole proprietor can withdraw from such savings in order to expand his/her business. The sole proprietor can also use such funds to buy more raw materials or machinery such as a computer, printer, fax machine, etc. to expand his /her output and make some profit.\n\n\
2. Loans from relations /friends: A sole proprietor can borrow money from relations and friends and pay back at a later time without paying any interest. Such funds can be used to buy more raw materials, equipment and tools to produce more goods for sale.\n\n\
3. Loans from banks and other financial institutions: A sole proprietor can obtain funds for expansion from banks and other financial institutions like co-operative/credit unions and money lenders. Such loans attract interest and in the case of bank loans collateral securities are often required.\n\n\
4. Hire purchase: The sole proprietor can acquire machines and equipment through hire purchase agreements. With this hire purchase agreements the sole proprietor makes part payments and the balance paid by instalments overtime.\n\n\
5. Trade Credit: Trade credits are agreements whereby a sole proprietor receives goods on credit and pays back after he / she has sold them. This is another means of providing capital for expansion.\n\n\
6. Rent/Lease: A private entrepreneur can get finance from leasing his machines to companies or individuals for agricultural production or manufacturing. When leasing is done the leaseholder or leasee will pay the owner upon usage of the equipment, machine, land etc. That is, someone can lease a tractor to a farmer for a year and the leasee (farmer) will pay an agreed amount upon returning the machine. Again, a private entrepreneur can raise funds to start a business by renting his building for a year or two and demand an advance payment\n\n\
7. Ploughed Back Profits: The sole proprietor can raise funds by retaining or ploughing back profits into the business. This .is made possible if the sole proprietor does not spend all the profits that accrue into the business but keeps some of it which are later re-invested into the business to expand it by purchasing raw materials and equipment since he does not make huge profits like the big farms.\n\n\
8. Inheritance: The death of a relative may leave a sole proprietor large sums of money which he can use to start or expand his business. Friends and relatives can give financial support or in any kind to a sole proprietor to start a business.\n\n\
9. Investment promotion schemes: The government through its investment promotion' schemes creates specialized agencies which give soft loans to sole proprietors. The Private Enterprise Foundation (PEF) is another source the private entrepreneur can use to finance his business. The PEP assists small scale businesses by providing them with opportunities to access funds to finance their small-scale businesses. The National Board for Small Scale Industries (NBSSI) also assists small and micro businesses to source funds"

question: "10a. Discuss four factors that can account for the low standard of living in Ghana .",
options: "\
1. Unskilled labour force leading to lower output of living in Ghana. Ghana's education system is too bookish and does not train people to acquire skills needed in industries, farming etc. In the farming sector, for example, about 70% of the farmers are peasant farmers who lack modern approach to fanning. They farm using outmoded farm tools like cutlasses, sticks, hoes etc. Many farmers farm on small pieces of land and because they lack the means to undertake large - scale production. The result is[hat output from our peasant farmers are low. This explains why Ghana has to rely on food import like rice, maize and vegetables like tomatoes, onions, beans etc. Low productivity especially in agriculture leads to widespread hunger and low living standards.\n\n\
2. Low savings because of low salaries and wages can account for low standard of living in Ghana. In Ghana many workers receive low salaries and wages and as a result their capacity to save is very low. Many workers in the Government and the private sectors are receive very low wages. This means that the average Ghanaian can hardly subsist on their low wage if such a person is married with children. If this worker has to spend his meagre monthly wage on rent, food, health, education, transportation etc. there will be little or nothing left for saving. This explains why capital formation in Ghana is low because of the poverty level of the worker.\n\n\
3. Low investment because of low salaries and wages: Low salaries and wages lead to low saving, and consequently to small amount of funds being available for investment purposes. The majority of the population of Ghana spends a large proportion of their meager salaries on food, rent, education, health, transpo1t etc. instead of investing it. With low income little is left for saving for and investment. In addition, there is greater propensity to consume on the part of the worker, resulting in low savings for investment.\n\n\
4. High dependency burden due to high population growth: The high rate of population growth in Ghana is due to the high birth rate and low death rate. The effect of this high birth rate and low death rate is big dependent population of children and old people who have to be catered for by the government and the labour force. This high dependent population is a drain on the resources of the government and the labour force. The government will have to spend more on the provision of basic social amenities such as schools, clinic, medical, water and housing instead of using such resources to import machines, plants, equipment, raw materials etc. for industries to increase output. More people means more months to be fed and this will result in government expenditure on food import to supplement local supply. With high dependency burden the majority of the people cannot afford to feed their families lived and cannot also enjoy modern means of livelihood.\n\n\
5. Poor attitude to work by both workers and management: The problem of poor attitude to work persists because of lack of effective supervision in the activities of the organisation he is employed. Some supervisors come to work late or use the working hours to run their own businesses. Again, some managers plan with their subordinates to steal funds and materials of the business and sell them. All these negative attitudes reduce the company's profits and the management may find it difficult to recoup the amount of money it has invested in the organisation. The resultant effect will be low output, high prices of goods and low standard of living.\n\n\
6. Poor quality of labour force due to slow technological growth: Ghana lacks people with skills due its education system which is geared towards training of people for white collar jobs. As a result, the country has few scientists, doctors, researchers, technically oriented people etc. Since Ghana has very few technical schools, colleagues of technology as well as vocational schools it means that these institutions cannot produce many people with technical or vocational knowledge or skills. Again, many of these institutions lack infrastructure like lecture theatre, classrooms, laboratories, books, furniture etc. adequate machines and equipment needed to expand and undertake research or train more people. With few technical and vocational personnel, a large proportion of the labour force who cannot have access to these institutions will qe of poor quality due to the slow rate which the country's technological growth is progressing.\n\n\
7. Poor Infrastructural development: The infrastructural development of Ghana is in a very bad state. Roads in rural and urban areas have developed big pot holes thereby making vehicular movement very difficult and affecting trade and commerce. Farming communities in the country cannot transport their foodstuffs, and vegetables and cash crops to the marketing centres in the urban centres. Due to the poor nature of roads and bridges, farmers cannot therefore earn a reasonable income from their labour since most of the foodstuffs and crops they produce get rotten on the farms."

question: "10b. Highlight four measures that can be used to raise the standard of living in Ghana.",
options: "\
1. Raising the level of investment: The habit of savings should be encouraged since savings and investment are positively related. When the interest rate on savings is raised it will encourage more people to save from which investors can borrow to buy machines, raw materials, build factory houses and also expand their businesses to increase production to promote the economic growth of the country. The government can create an environment that will encourage people to save at the banks from which savings entrepreneurs will borrow to invest in productive ventures. When there is adequate investment made in all the sectors of the economy as a result of increase in savings it will result in increase investment in capital goods which is needed to improve such social and economic infrastructures such as roads telecommunications, health, education, etc.\n\n\
2. Making education and training accessible to all: The government should rehabilitate schools which are in a very bad state to encourage pupils attends school. New schools buildings should be provided for children who attend school under tress so that such children do not migrate to other towns to attend school. Facilities in the existing senior high schools should also be expanded to accommodate many students. Again, the universities and polytechnics should also be expanded to take in more students. The Fee Free Education for the Senior High Schools is a laudable idea as this will enable poor parents to send their children to school.\n\n\
3. Improving technical and vocational training: The government should provide the technical and vocational institutions with more workshops equipped with equipment and tools to enable them undertake more practical training. The technical and vocational institutions should be rehabilitated and expanded to enable them increase their intake of students. When students acquire the requisite training it enables to handle particular machines property and for work to be done correctly. This will enable students who complete their courses to acquire better jobs and earn good income.\n\n\
4. Improvement in agriculture through better farming techniques or modern technology is a measure to improve the standard of living in the country: Farmers are now encouraged to clear their land and prepare it in lines, which helps in easy weeding and control of pests and diseases. Planting in lines allows for easy harvesting and results in higher yield. The government should also encourage farmers to use better or modern agricultural machinery like ploughs, tractors, planters and harvesters for large-scale agricultural production. There is improved varieties of livestock such as cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, fowls and crops such as rice, millet, maize etc. Farmers are also to adopt better pest control methods and apply insecticides on affected plants regularly. Irrigation of dry lands is encouraged in the north to boost agricultural production. Field water are now conserved in simple dams and distributed along irrigation floods where necessary. Improvement in agriculture through better farming techniques has helped to increase food producti0n leading to better standard of living.\n\n\
5. Population policies to reduce the rapid growth in population: There is the need for the government to ensure that the population of the country matches her resources. The rate of population growth of Ghana is increasing faster than the available resources so there is the need to limit the growth of population through serious and massive campaign to encourage family limitation. The government can control the population by encouraging people to adopt family planning which will offer people with opportunities to consciously decide freely and responsibly on the number of children they wish to have and when to have them by spacing the birth of their children. Again, the government can provide family planning clinics where married couples and the youth can go for advice or information on birth control measures. There should be very effective information education and communication programmes on family life education especially in our educational institutions. The effect of this policy is that family size will reduce which will reduce dependency burden and improve the standard of living of the people.\n\n\
6. Change in attitude to work to increase labour productivity: Many Ghanaian employees regard government employment as belonging to somebody else. They therefore adopt negative attitude like absenteeism, lateness, laziness, loitering, pilfering etc., which results in low productivity and a low standard of living. The Ghanaian should need to change their negative attitude to work by being punctual at work, using their working hours wisely and reducing waste so that labour productivity can increase to raise the standard of living of the people. Workers should exhibit hard work, good interpersonal relations, honesty, loyalty, to increase productivity at the work place.\n\n\
7. Improvement working conditions: Poor conditions of service, in terms of low salaries, allowances and lack of accommodation do not only create job dissatisfaction, they also dampens the efforts of workers. Management of businesses and the government should make attempt to pay workers well to increase their productivity. The conditions under which work is done can affect workers output or efficiency. To increase workers' efficiency, adequate ventilation, lighting and sanitation are important. Over crowding must be avoided since this affects efficiency and health of the worker"
