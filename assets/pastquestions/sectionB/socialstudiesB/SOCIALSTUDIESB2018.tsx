id: "question1b",
question: "1b. Describe four ways in which self-confidence can be built by the individual.",
definition: "The following are some of the ways in which self-confidence can be built by the individual.",
options: "\
1. Acquiring training: Training helps in discovering and developing a person’s potentials. It trains the mind and equips the individual with the needed skills required to develop these potentials. For example, through training a student can acquire skills at school which he/she can help his/her parents at home. For example, an individual can assist his/her mother to keep proper accounting record for his/her mother’s business. Training which the child acquires at technical schools helps the individual to develop his identified potentialities in fitting, masonry, carpentry etc. Again training and re-training of the individual helps to sharpen his skills and make him self-confident in his chosen profession.\n\n\
2. Making use of encouragement from peers: Peers can help their fellow peers to develop positive image of oneself. Through good advise and better way of moving together, this can help to mould the character of peers. Where an individual faces problems in class, his friends can assist him to come over such problem be it academic or social. Peers are always together and therefore stand a better chance of correcting the bad behaviour of their friends. Peers can cheer up their friends when they perform better in class or during inter-school games. This will boost their morale.\n\n\
3. Making use of encouragement from teachers: Teachers stand a better chance of knowing their students’ academic and social lives. In class, teachers can boost the morale of students by rewarding them with words such as: Good work, keep it up, don’t give up etc. With such encouraging words students are activated to work harder. Students need the encouragement from their teachers since they serve as role models and pick certain behaviours from them.\n\n\
4. Going through guidance and counselling: Individuals can develop self confidence when they are guided by guidance and counselling coordinators in educational institutions and various communities to solve their personal problems. Through guidance and counselling, the students can be advised by the counselling coordinator in the school to choose courses that can help develop their self-confidence.\n\n\
5. Acquiring Quality Education: For the individual to develop his/her self confidence he/she needs attend school and ensure that he/she has acquired the level of education that can make to him/her fit well into the society. Half-baked education is no education since it cannot develop the self confidence of the individual. Quality education is necessary for the total development of one’s self confidence since such education must develop the total human being and make the individual productive in the society.\n\n\
6. Knowing one’s strengths and weaknesses: An individual has to know himself or herself so that he/she can identify his/her weaknesses and shortcomings. Some of these may be arrogance, pride, laziness, self-praising, drunkenness, stealing etc. If an individual is arrogant he/she can be helped to correct or overcome it and thus become a good citizen in the community. Knowing one’s strengths will also enable one to strive hard to lead morally good life to serve as example to others.\n\n\
7. Availability of enabling environment by the state: The individual should take advantage of the enabling environment created by the state to meet his needs and aspirations. The state has provided technical schools, training centres, vocational schools, MASLOC at various regions, and districts to solve the manpower needs of the country. The government should therefore improve the educational infrastructure to train many idle students to enable them set up their own businesses.\n\n\
8. Taking leadership roles: Agencies like the school, mass media, religious groups, youth associations like Boys Scouts, Girls’ Guide etc. can be very crucial in shaping the character and values of the individual. The individual can take up leadership role in some of these organisations which and up invariably will help to boost his/her morale and self-confidence.\n\n\
9. Provision of conducive home environment: Parents, siblings, guardians and family members have an important role in providing an enabling environment at home which will be conducive enough to develop the individual’s self-confidence. The love and encouragement that parents, siblings, family members give to the individual will enhance his image and strengthen his potential and equip him with the tools necessary for his future life. Parents must also provide the needs of children and ensure that their rights are protected. This will make the child have confidence in himself and his immediate relatives.\n\n\
10. Self-determination: The individual can develop self-confidence by having a sense of vision to identify his hidden talents and other human qualities. Sense of vision also means goal setting. Once the individual has recognised his set goals in life it becomes necessary for him to make a systematic planning or work hard to achieve these goals that he has set for himself in life. In his effort to achieve these set goals the individual must know that there will be obstacles in his way. By developing positive self-confidence, the individual can overcome these obstacles and achieve his set goals in life. For example, a student who is determined to be a medical doctor in future will have to learn very hard to achieve his future aim.\n\n\
11. Emulating Role Models: Through the process of role taking the individual learns to know himself by creating an image of himself and by identifying somebody as a role model. During child play one often sees children playing the role of a father, mother, doctor, teacher, soldier, etc. Through this process the child learns to wield power and exert authority over those he/she finds as subordinates. Some of these children out of these primary leadership roles emerge to become renowned leaders in their future social life. The individual, therefore, by identifying himself or herself with inspiring and prominent people in the society tries to take over certain characteristics or traits of these role models; which invariably help to boost his/her ego and confidence in life.\n\n\
12. Facing challenges and taking responsibilities (risks): The ability of individuals to take risks. and face challenges will enable them develop their self-confidence. The development of self-confidence requires individuals to make systematic planning. In the course of developing their self-confidence, they are likely to face challenges which may discourage them so it is through hard work and persistent effort from themselves that will enable them to achieve their goals"

id: "question2",
question: "2. Highlight five ways in which children expose their parents as being irresponsible.",
definition: "The following are some of the ways by which children cause their parents to be irresponsible:",
options: "\
1. Displaying of laziness: Displaying of laziness is the unwillingness to put much effort to work leading to non-performance in school and life. Children also expose their parents as being irresponsible when they refuse to assist their parents at home to cook, wash or assist them on their farms. Students who do not show seriousness in their academic work and are lazy in class end up getting low grades in their final examination and cannot achieve their aim of becoming a doctor, engineer, accountant etc. thereby exposing their parents as irresponsible.\n\n\
2. Engaging in drug abuse, promiscuity, alcoholism, teenage pregnancy: Drug abuse is the use of drugs not prescribed by a qualified medical officer. Some adolescents smoke hard drugs e.g. Indian hemp, cannabis, cocaine etc out of frustration and bad peer influence. This can lead to crime and mental disorders. An adolescent who indulges in drugs will not be able to learn well to enable him/her pass his/her examination. He/she will be a drop out and become a deviant in the society. This will expose his parents as being irresponsible since they were unable to train and take good care of the child. Children who indulge in drugs lead promiscuous life and can become pregnant.\n\n\
3. Engaging in social vices e.g. armed robbery, drug trafficking, prostitution: Adolescents engage in armed robbery as a result of drug abuse and lust for material things. Youth who engage in armed robbery as a means of survival or under the influence of peer pressure use weapons to rob people. Such individuals can be apprehended and imprisoned. Children who engage in such activities expose their parents as irresponsible since they could not control them when they were young. The engagement in promiscuous sexual activities due to lust for maternal gains has made many girls to become prostitutes. Prostitution can result from poor parental care which can make the adolescent indulge in sexual activities to feed and cloth herself. The girl child who indulges in prostitution can contract STDs, and this can lead to sickness and death. Parents of such children expose themselves as irresponsible.\n\n\
4. Engaging in streetism: Parental irresponsibility can lead to child neglect. If parents are unable to provide the needs of their children they will find ways and means to satisfy their basic and other needs. Such children will end up on the streets doing menial jobs to get food to eat.\n\n\
5. Engaging in economic activities: Children expose their parents as irresponsible if they are unable to pay their school fees and provide their basic needs. Some children may stop schooling and end up on the streets as “Kayaye”. Some children sell dog chains, bread, pure water, car dusters etc. on the streets to enable them earn some money either to pay their school fees or to provide their basic needs like food, clothing etc.\n\n\
6. Marrying at a very young age: Some young girls drop out of school because of poor parental care while others may be due to poor academic standard and therefore drop out of school. Such girls marry at a very young age. These children expose their parents as irresponsible because they were unable to take good care of their girl-child and out of their desire for money give her out in marriage.\n\n\
7. Gross misconduct of children: The behaviour of many children is such that they can make or cause their parents to behave in ways that may make them irresponsible. For example, when a child smokes or drinks or leads promiscuous life this will make parents to be angry and behave in a away that may not be pleasant to the child. The child may show disrespect to the parents and even snob their advise.\n\n\
8. Ingratitude and resentfulness: Ingratitude and resentfulness on the part of children could be very hurtful and may lead parents to behave in ways that may seem irresponsible. When children are not grateful to their parents for providing their needs and do not reciprocate by performing their duties in the house this will make parents to show little interest in them. The children may become peeved and show no respect for their parents.\n\n\
9. Flouting parental authority: Children may deliberately disobey or flout parental authority. Such children join their peers to form gangs which parents fear could be harmful to their children, and may tend to make parents behave irresponsibly towards them, since they refused to take their advise.\n\n\
10. Peer influence: Children may join their peers in activities like smoking, drinking, drug abuse etc. which parents may speak against such behaviour because they could be harmful to their children. This may tend to make parents become irritable and as a result disown the child.\n\n\
11. Poor performance in school: Parents love their children and would do anything possible to ensure that they do well in school. When the child frequently submits poor academic report this discourages parents from paying their school fees. Children who are lazy at school may not do their homework or assignments given them. Such children tend to copy other friends’ homework and present them as their own. When a child’s continuous assessment from school shows poor performance, this will make the parents feel worried about the huge school fees they pay as waste and may decide to stop. The parents may now feel that the investment they are making in their children is unnecessary and may therefore stop paying their school fees. The end result is that the child will have to drop out of school and become a vagabond, thus exposing the parents as irresponsible.\n\n\
12. Engaging in truancy and absenteeism from school: Children who join bad friends who are truants are likely to copy their way of life. Truant children normally fail to attend classes and their academic record reflects a very poor performance at school. Truant children normally cut classes to be able to join their friends so that they can indulge in stealing, drinking, smoking and taking drugs. Parents become irresponsible when they find their children indulging in this way of life if they fail to listen to their advice and warnings.\n\n\
13. Refusal to perform assigned duties: Every parent would want to see his/her children perform house chores. This involves sweeping, running of errands, washing dishes, cooking etc. Failure to perform these chores attracts the anger and warnings of their parents. If the child continues to persist in this bad behavior his/her parents may feel reluctant to buy the child new clothes or even pay his or her school fees and also cut his/her pocket money. Stubborn children may persist in this behavior and this will cause their parents to be irresponsible by not supplying the child with his/her basic needs."

id: "question3",
question: "3. Describe five possible measures you would take to conserve the physical environment.",
definition: "Measures I would take to conserve the physical environment are the following:",
options: "\
1. Non-involvement in felling of trees: Excessive cutting down of trees for lumbering, farming or for fuel wood (firewood or charcoal) without replacing them can lead to deforestation. Therefore it is necessary that illegal felling of trees is not encouraged and I will ensure that people who willfully cut down trees are sanctioned to serve as deterrent to others.\n\n\
2. Non involvement in bush burning: Bush burning is caused mostly through human activity as a result of slash and burn system of farming, palm wine tapping, cigarette buts, hunting expeditions, arson (that is burning out of fury) etc. Since the causes are known I will advise farmers to control bush fires by creating fire belts between farms to check the spread of bush fires. Modern fire-fighting equipment can also be used to put out bush fires promptly.\n\n\
3. Using proper and efficient waste disposal and management methods: Waste management techniques are needed for the disposal of sewage and liquid waste. Public toilets must be provided to ensure that people do not defecate along the sea shores and in the bushes. Metropolitan, Municipal, and District Assemblies should provide litter boxes or containers at public places so that pedestrians, traders and hawkers can use them in disposing their waste materials. The dust bin and the big containers which are placed at vantage points should be emptied as soon as they are full. Oil tankers and oil exploration firms which pollute the water bodies should be made to clean the water bodies. Industrial waste can be buried deep in the earth like in old abandoned mines or quarries.\n\n\
4. Discouraging farming activities closer to water bodies: I will advise the various Assembly members and DEC’s to prohibit the cutting down of trees near water bodies in their localities so the waters bodies do not dry up. The government should also encourage farmers who farm along water bodies to desist from such a practice but create forest reserves along river banks to serve as shield to protect water bodies from the rays of the sun.\n\n\
5. Educating others on environmental sanitation: Public education enables people to know the harmful effects of human activities on the environment. The news media -radio, television and the daily papers can be used to make the general public aware of the need to keep their surroundings clean. People must desist from dumping solid and liquid waste anyhow and also refrain from burning refuse in n residential areas to pollute the air. The agency responsible for the protection of the environment, the Environmental Protection Agency, should organise public seminars, lectures and workshops in the urban and the rural areas to educate the people on the measures they can take to protect the environment from littering the environment with refuse. The government can also organize monthly environmental sanitation throughout the whole country to rid it off filth and rubbish\n\n\
6. Supporting imposition of fines and sanctions of offenders: I will support sanctions imposed on offenders who degrade the environment. The government should prosecute people who do not keep their surroundings clean or observe proper environmental sanitation. Sanitary officers should go round to sanction those who violate the sanitation laws. The Assemblies can also, solve environmental sanitation by providing enough litter boxes or containers at public places so that pedestrians, traders and hawkers can use them in disposing their waste materials. People who make the environment dirty must be made to pay some fine and sanctioned.\n\n\
7. Promoting the use of LPG in homes instead of firewood: The government should promote the use of Liquified Petroleum (LP) Gas both at domestic and commercial levels. The price of LPG should be reduced to encourage many homes to use LPG instead of using firewood and charcoal which lead to deforestation.\n\n\
8. Observing bye-laws on environmental sanitation and cleanliness: The District, Municipal and Metropolitan Assembles should ensure that all the bye-laws on environmental sanitation and cleanliness are observed and the sanctions attached to them are observed to ensure proper environmental sanitation and cleanliness. People who violate the bye-laws must be penalized to deter others from doing same.\n\n\
9. Supporting instituted good land use policies: The Town and Country Planning Department has to ensure proper planning of towns and cities. The District and Regional Offices have to see to it that an area that has been reserved for a specific activity is not used for something else. The Town and Country Planning Department also has to ensure that towns and cities are properly planned in such a way that people do not build in wetland areas which are prone to flooding. Water channels and big gutters must be constructed to prevent flooding. Gutters constructed must be of reasonable size to accommodate the volume of water when it rains. Storm drains must be constructed especially where we have lagoons or streams so that when it rains they can contain the volume of water flowing through them. Chocked gutters must be desilted to allow free flow of water through them.\n\n\
10. Demonstrating good land use practices. e.g. mixed farming, shifting cultivation, etc.: Farmers should be encouraged to adopt proper farming methods like mixed farming, crop rotation and shifting cultivation. These methods of farming will enable the land to enrich the soil. Shifting cultivation, for example, will allow the land to lie fallow for some years before planting. This will enable the land to regain its fertility for another planting season. Mixed farming has the potential of enriching the soil with nutrients from crops planted. Excessive use of chemicals like fertilizers and pesticides in farming should be minimized since they cause leaching and soil erosion. Instead, organic manure like the droppings of fowl, cow dung etc should be used by farmers to improve agricultural production.\n\n\
11. Planting more trees: The problem of deforestation can be minimised by afforestation. Afforestation involves the planting of trees on a bare land to make the area a forest. The leaves that fall from the trees make the soil fertile again. The yearly tree planting exercise undertaken by schools should be made compulsory for all schools in the country. Students should also be encouraged to plant trees in their locality every year as a way of ensuring that the land is not left bear.\n\n\
12. Re-planting of trees: There should be re-afforestation programme whereby when the wood-lot is cut it is immediately re-planted to make the land acquire its former vegetation. The trees planted will help to conserve certain trees or plants that are very important to man.\n\n\
13. Supporting good mining practices: Unscientific mining can be minimized by the government ensuring that efficient mining methods are adopted. Unscientific methods of mining, popularly known as “galamsey” often involves indiscriminate digging of trenches which destroys vegetation and farmlands. “Galamsey” operators should be registered and given specific location to operate under strict supervision by the Mineral Commission. The government should ensure that illegal miners use modern machines in mining and their mining activities conform to the standards set by the Mineral Commission. The Assembly’s monitoring team should ensure that mining companies adopt efficient mining methods like undertaking massive tree planting exercise to revert the land to its original state after mining activities.\n\n\
14. Encouraging good fishing practices: Fishermen should be advised to adopt proper fishing methods and stop using poisonous chemicals like D.D.T to pollute the rivers or sea. The use of mono filament fishing nets which kill the small and baby fish and thus reduce the fish stock in the waters must be stopped. Fishermen must be educated on the need to fish with approved nets which do not catch both the big and the small fish. Farmers who fish with dynamite and in the deep seas should be advised to desist from such behaviour as they would be prosecuted when caught.\n\n\
15. Encouraging recycling of waste: The various assemblies can recycle all solid wastes like raw sewage (human excreta) into bio-gas to generate electricity for domestic use. Sewage, for example, can be turned from their organic matter state into compost and manure for use as fertilizers on farms. Garbage can also be processed into compost which can be used as organic manure in vegetable production. Polythene waste, cans, waste papers etc. can be recycled as raw materials for industries"

question: "4a. Distinguish between formal education and non-formal education.",
definition: "Formal education is a type of education in which teaching and learning is carried out in specifically built institutions. What is taught is based on well-structured syllabus and timetable. Assessment is assessed on practical and written works. But/Whilst/However/Nevertheless/On the Other Hand (Choose one) Non formal education is a system of teaching and learning which takes place outside the main system of formal education. It may have syllabus and timetable like the formal education. An example is the adult education.",
},


{
id: "question4b",
question: "4b. Describe four characteristics of informal education.",
definition: "Characteristics Of Informal Education",
options: "\
1. It is not evaluated: In Informal education, learning is measured by means of oral tests, quizzes and practical work. Since teaching is carefully supervised by parents, siblings, friends, peers etc. the learner feels at home and follows instructions and activities that go on throughout the interaction with his/her informal teachers. If a girl cooks and makes a mistake the mother or sister is there to teach her the right way of preparing palm soup or stew.\n\n\
2. It is character training oriented. Informal education teaches the child about his/her community’s standards of conduct as well as qualities like courage, hardwork, truthfulness and faithfulness.\n\n\
3. Non-clearly defined roles: The role of the teacher and the learner are not clearly defined since most of the learning activities are unconscious. The child picks certain activities or performances from the parents or at gatherings of elders.\n\n\
4. In formal education the medium of instruction is mainly through the local language: Since parents, siblings, friends, peers, elders etc use the local language in their instruction the child can express him/herself clearly and does not feel shy. This enables the child to understand what he/she is taught.\n\n\
5. It is meant for all citizens: Informal education does not discriminate as every child or citizen can learn from any family member without having pay any money. In any home or community members acquire all manner of skills like drumming, farming and other activities from their parents and other members of the community without paying for their services.\n\n\
6. Assessment is by demonstration: In informal education, learning is by watching what the parents, siblings, friends etc. do and the individual does the same. To asses the learner he/she must put into practise what he/she has learnt from or seen his/her parents, siblings, friends etc. do. The child is corrected when he/she goes wrong.\n\n\
7. Indigenous education does not require campuses nor buildings: There are no built. institutions, classrooms or a place for learning. Every aspect for the physical and social environment is regarded as the place of learning. Information education is therefore characterized by fact-to-face interaction. It is often carried out in the homes, farms, market- place, and workshop etc. parents and other family members and friends, who teach, in informal situations, know their subjects and how to teach them.\n\n\
8. Every adult becomes the teacher the father, mother, uncle, aunt and every member in the community is a teacher Parents, peers, religious institutions etc carry it out. For example, children from farming communities learn from their parents how to plant and harvest crops. Girls learn from their mothers the domestic chores like sweeping, cooking, washing etc. Children imitate adult roles without getting guidance from their parents\n\n\
9. No Use of Professional Teachers: Indigenous education does not involve professional/trained teachers. Teaching is carefully supervised by parents and friends. Evaluation methods are practical. The excellent performance of the learner gives him joy and satisfaction.\n\n\
10. Unscientific Approach: The method of teaching is practical as most teaching is done by personal examples, questioning and demonstrations; learning is also done by observation and personal participation. It is practical and vocation- oriented in the sense whatever is imparted to the learners is followed up with practical illustration or demonstration.\n\n\
11. Learning is Unstructured: Indigenous education is not well-organised or structured with syllabuses, timetable. Learning is not structured with defined environment. Much of the learning is unconscious, informal, unstructured and relies on oral transmission. Work is not graded to suit the age and ability of the learner."

question: "5b. Examine four causes of ethnic conflicts in Ghana.",
definition: "The following are some of the causes of ethnic conflict in Ghana:",
options: "\
1. Land Disputes/Litigation: Land disputes are a major source of conflict in our nation. For example, the conflicts between Alavanyo and Nkonya centred on land ownership, and so is the. conflict between Tsito and Peki in the Volta Region. There had been at least 13 inter-ethnic and intra ethnic conflicts in the North between 1980 and 1994.\n\n\
2. Chieftaincy disputes/Power struggle: Chieftaincy disputes are conflicts revolve around issues of inheritance and succession, which in turn are due to the absence of a uniform and legally enforceable set of governing rules. For example. the feud over the succession dispute arising from the death of Ya Na Abdulai Andani II. Disagreements between the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP) and the opposition National Democratic Congress( NDC) over certain policies (e.g. ROPAL) can cause conflict in the society.\n\n\
3. Intolerance: There have been conflicts between churches and the Ga Traditional Council over the ban on drumming during certain period of the year-i.e. conflicts over the right to worship versus the right to the observance of traditional customary practices; conflicts erupting between different Islamic sects, etc. Often religious conflicts arise out of doctrinal differences.\n\n\
4. Unfair distribution of resources: At times, if a section of the society feels that it is not being treated fairly in the distribution of the national cake, appointments to prominent positions in government this situation may lead to conflict\n\n\
5. Injustice: Conflict may arise if a person feels cheated and will therefore retaliate. In other cases, people’s assets were unfairly confiscated; people were arbitrarily dismissed from the public service; and some were arbitrarily executed. These are human rights violations and can create resentments and conflicts. In other words, disregard for the rule of law lies at the root of some of the conflicts that plague our society\n\n\
6. Greed/Dishonesty: If some citizens decide to have more of the resources e.g. farmland, inheritance etc. of community, this can generate into conflict. When some family members feel they are cheated in the sharing of family property the aggrieved party may take arms to protect their property.\n\n\
7. Discrimination: When a section of the community feels the are discriminated because they a minority group, then such people may harbour some ill- feeling which can develop into resentment against the chief or family head.\n\n\
8. Stereotyping or misconception: This results from tagging people as thieves, murderers, cheats, misers etc. For example, Fantes have been tagged as comedians, Ewes as inward-looking people etc. Such stereotyping can cause rage in these people and cause conflict."

{
id: "question6",
question: "6. Describe five ways by which people can attain leadership positions in the Ghanaian society.",
definition: "The following are some of the ways people can attain leadership positions in the Ghanaian society:",
options: "\
1. By appointment: A person can become a leader through appointment based on ability and past experience. The government appointments the Headmaster, Principal or Headteacher of a school. Such people by teaching for a certain number of years and having the requisite qualification go through an interview and are appointed by the Ghana Education Service as Heads of Schools.\n\n\
2. By self imposition/ appointment: A person can become a leader by imposing himself on others. Such a person can become a leader through unapproved means, as in a military take-over. Such a person with a group of military men overthrow a constitutionally elected government and becomes the Head of the military junta. The leader of the group imposes his will on the people and becomes the Head of State as happened in Ghana during the AFRC regime.\n\n\
3. By direction / by choice of members of the organisation: A leader may arise through direct or indirect election. In a democratic country, leaders are elected to man various positions. For example, the president becomes the leader of the nation through general elections. School prefects, class prefects, T.U.C., Secretary General, GNAT Secretary General are put into such positions through election.\n\n\
4. Through hereditary: In traditional societies where chieftaincy or royal succession operates, the heir of a throne assumes his leadership position immediately the occupant dies, because he is related by blood to the occupant of the throne. For example, in Ghana when a chief dies he is succeeded either by his brother, son or nephew.\n\n\
5. Situational leaders: Situational leaders emerge during crises to solve problems. When there is a serious problem, someone may emerge as the suitable person to solve the problem. Such a person leaves the scene after the problem is solved. Such position is not permanent.\n\n\
6. Charismatic leadership: Charismatic leaders are people who possess strong personalities and inherent qualities that inspire others. They easily attract people to themselves and are able to rally people around to undertake communal projects.\n\n\
7. Based on age: Leadership may also emerge due to age. One who is advanced in age may command respect and can easily control people under his control. Such a person may emerge as a leader.\n\n\
8. Based on character: A leader may emerge because he is humble, respectful, tactful and is liked by people of all ages.\n\n\
9. Based on one’s outstanding contribution in the community: An active person tends to be seen by others as a leader. By working hard for the group. such a person may gain the recognition and the respect of the group and find himself/herself emerging as its leader."

{
id: "question7",
question: "7. Explain five situations under which the rights of the individual can be lawfully curtailed. Answer: The following are some of the conditions under which one’s rights could be violated:",
options: "\
1. When public order or national security is required: The individual’s rights could be violated when public order or national security is required e.g. during periods of siege or crisis, curfew, state of emergency etc. When the government declares a state of emergency or imposes a curfew, the curfew will affect the individual’s freedom of movement and may suffer some other inconvenience. Individuals may also be debarred from entering places of strategic importance e.g. military installations, etc.\n\n\
2. When a person is convicted of crime or treason by a court, he can be put in prison: If an individual is arraigned before a court of law for breaking the law or committing an offence, the exercise of his rights and liberties may be limited, especially if the offender is remanded in custody. Law breakers and armed robbers may be convicted or put in prisons to ease social tension. The confinement will restrict the offender’s right of movement, and also suffer some agony.\n\n\
3. People suffering from insanity and other deformities: Persons who are mentally and physically unsound have to be confined in psychiatric or mental hospitals or isolated from society. This limits their right to exercise their freedom of movement. Contagious diseases such as leprosy may also limit somebody’s movement, because such a disease may spread. By keeping such people in isolated areas they are prevented from exercising their right.\n\n\
4. Applying the laws of libel, slander and sedition: The laws of the libel, slander and sedition also violate the rights of an individual’s freedom of speech and action. Such law’s do not allow and individual to publish anything, say anything or do anything designed to defame or injure the reputation of another person or to incite public disorder or rebellion against the government.\n\n\
5. When a person fails to pay his/her taxes promptly and honestly: It is the responsibility of every worker to pay his/her taxes to enable the government provide the amenities the people need. When a person fails to pay his/her taxes promptly and honestly, he can be sent to court and when found guilty he can be jailed.\n\n\
6. Indecent exposure of parts of body: It is against the laws of the country for any person to dress indecently or walk about on the streets exposing his/herself to the public in an obscene way. Such a person can be arrested and prosecuted. When found guilty he will be jailed: Trading in sex services or prostitution affect the dignity, moral values and the health of the people concerned. Girls who practise prostitution can be arranged before court and when found guilty will be jailed. Their freedom of movement is therefore curtailed.\n\n\
7. Engaging in unlawful associations: Every citizen has the freedom and right to assemble and associate with others. However, persons who assemble for unlawful purposes with the aim of planning the overthrow of a lawfully constituted government of the country will be arrested and prosecuted before a court of justice. Again, if the government is convinced that some people are engaging in unlawful associations designed to undermine law and order e.g. forming syndicates to steal or kill or overthrow a government in power, the government may prevent the activity from taking place. This will interfere with the individual’s political rights.\n\n\
8. Entry into restricted areas e.g. military installations, forest reserves etc.: It is unlawful for people to loiter around military installations, water company facility, electricity transformers and installations, forest reserves etc. These are restricted areas because of the strategic nature of these facilities to the nation. People who violate this law can be prosecuted and jailed for entering a restricted area. In most cases, the facility ensures that warning signs are indicated at places where the installations are built to warn people from loitering in that area."

question: "8b. In what four ways are natural resources beneficial to Ghanaians?",
definition: "The following are some of the ways by which natural resources are beneficial to Ghanaians:",
options: "\
1. Source of foreign exchange: Natural resources such as minerals like gold and bauxite, timber, cocoa, banana, pineapple etc. constitute major source of foreign exchange to the government of Ghana. Ghana produces cocoa and several non-traditional export commodities (pineapple, kola nuts, yam, cashew nuts etc.) and forest products – notably timber for export. These products which are exported earn foreign exchange for the country. The export of dry cocoa beans as well as several non traditional export commodities and timber contributed about $449 million or 43% of the total foreign exchange earned in 1993.\n\n\
2. Provides Employment: – Natural resources offer employment to a large proportion of the labour as farmers, fishermen, hunters, miners, loggers and farm labour. The agricultural and mining sectors offer employment to a large active labour force. These employment opportunities help to alleviate poverty and to reduce social vices in the country. As a source of employment, natural resources provide income to farmers who produce oranges, mangoes pineapples, apples etc. and sell them at the market.\n\n\
3. Source of revenue: Natural resources contribute substantially to government revenue mainly through duties / taxes paid on the export of natural resources, particularly cocoa, banana, gold, bauxite, timber etc. Royalties from mining companies and timber concessions form sizable proportion of government revenue.\n\n\
4. Provides food and water for use by humans: Natural resources provide food for the expanding rural and urban population. Almost all the food we eat comes from plants and/or animals, e.g. plantain, yam, cassava, sorghum, plantain, yam, cassava and cocoyam, beans, rice, fish, poultry and livestock. Our rivers provide water for domestic and industrial uses. Natural resources in addition to providing food for the people contribute to direct satisfaction of human wants by providing wood fuel, fish, bush meat etc. We use water for cooking, washing and providing electricity for the economic development of the country.\n\n\
5. Water bodies are source of generating hygdro- electric power for industrial and domestic use: Industries use electricity generated by the Akosombo Dam to turn their machines to produce goods for domestic and export markets. Examples of sources of electricity are from Volta Lake and Bui projects.\n\n\
6. Provide raw materials to feed agro-based industries: Natural resources supply raw materials like cocoa, cola-nut, palm oil, timber, cassava, gold, diamond, salt, water, etc. for the agro-based industries. Fruit Juice Companies use local fruits as their raw materials. Furniture manufacturers also depend on local timber for their production. Ameen Sangari Industry in Cape Coast depends on local palm oil as a source of its raw material to produce Ameen Soap. Uniliver Ghana Ltd. buys local palm oil to produce key soap, edible oil like frytol and palmin which are popular on the Ghanaian market. Astek fruit Processing Company Ltd. depends on local fruits such as pineapple, mango and orange to produce fruity, pure juice and the Refresh range (Orapine, pineapple, and orange).\n\n\
7. Tourist Attraction: Natural parks (Kakum National Park), Boti falls, crocodile pond at Paga, Beach resorts etc. are tourist sites which attract foreigners to such places of interest. The attraction of tourist sites has led to the development of dormant tourists sites in the regions.\n\n\
8. Natural resources provide means of transport: Water, air and land are used for transport purposes. Canoes and boats are used on rivers and lakes, while ships and other large vessels ply the seas. Water transport helps in the movement of people and goods.\n\n\
9. Natural resources provide water for irrigation: For example, the Tono Irrigation Project enables farmers to farm throughout the whole year. Through irrigation farmers can undertake rice farming and also to plant vegetables like tomato, onions etc throughout the year.\n\n\
10. Medicinal plants for the prevention and cure of diseases: Forests are a source of raw materials. for preparing various medicines. The barks, roots, leaves etc. of trees are used by herbalists and others. for treatment of illnesses and diseases. For example, the bark and leaves of some trees like mahogany and sapele are used as medicine for treating diseases like piles, and waist pains. Also manufactures of medicine also depend on trees for their drug (aspirin, quinine, chloroquine, etc.). commodities, thereby facilitating trade.\n\n\
11. Natural resources provide means of transportation (water, air and land): Water, air and land are used for transport purposes. Canoes and boats are used on rivers, sea and lakes, whiles ships and other huge vessels ply the seas. Water transport helps in the movement of people and commodities, thereby facilitating trade."

question: "10. Explain how five negative work ethics can affect business in Ghana",
options: "\
1. Lateness/Absenteeism: Many workers especially in Ghana go to work late and leave the work place earlier than closing time and do not see anything wrong with this. Workers who behave in this way do not have respect for time and the result of this behaviour is the loss of time or loss of man hours of work and inability to achieve set targets. This attitude leads to low output and haphazard work. It can cause delayed delivering of products. The result is lowering of labour productivity.\n\n\
2. Laziness: Many workers instead of devoting working hours to work, loiter around, receive visitors, work lotto and gossip. The reality is that many workers do not work hard when there is little supervision. The effect of this attitude is that workers tend to produce shoddy work to make up for lost time. Another effect is that the producer cannot meet dead line set for the market and this process leads to low output and reduces moral of other workers.\n\n\
3. Pilfering/Stealing: Some workers take certain items such as pens duplicating papers, official papers, envelopes, typewriters drugs, food and spare parts. For example, pilfering goes on in schools, offices, hotels, restaurants and hospitals. Shopkeepers steal goods from the stores of their employers. This means that valuable resources of the business are lost and funds that could have been used to increase output would have to be used to buy the stolen materials for production to continue.\n\n\
4. Corruption among workers: Bribery and corruption are common practices at work places. In most cases one often has to give out money for his work done otherwise the work is unnecessarily delayed. Sometimes an outright demand is made for a specific amount to have somebody else’s work done or put aside. This act of giving and receiving bribe is so much entrenched in the Ghanaian social fabric that work without an offer of bribe is not given the due attention it deserves. This negative work ethics can lead to undue bottlenecks affecting quality of work and vering productivity.\n\n\
5. Embezzlement of Funds: Misapplication sometimes may be for genuine reasons that are redirecting monies to where they were not originally allocated to but done to arrest an emergency issue. However, when misapplication becomes a common phenomena, it leads to embezzlement. That is people divert monies belonging to their employers for their private use. They use such monies to buy cars, build houses, buy lands or operate a private business. As a result of this, large sums of money are usually lost to institutions and business organisations as accountant, cashiers, accounts clerks, revenue collectors and managers fail to account for such monies. This situation can cause the collapse of the business\n\n\
6. Leaking of confidential information: Some workers in sensitive positions may leak confidential information which may be the trade secret of the company to its competitors who may use the information to work against the business. The company may loose some of its customers to other competitors since they are in the same line of production. This can cause the collapse of the company.\n\n\
7. Loitering: Some workers are in the habit of loitering about when they come to work. What they do is that they leave their work and move from one office to the other either selling things to other workers or gossiping about their colleague workers. This behaviour leads to loss of man-hours of work as well as loss of manpower leading to low productivity.\n\n\
8. Falsification of Accounts: Most employers do not have basic accounting knowledge and as such the Accountant and his supporting staff exploit the ignorance of their employers and make false claims or alter documents or make forged documents to enable them steal the company’s money Sometimes hospital bills, transport claims and other bills inflated to benefit the Accountant or the one presenting the bills. This behaviour reduces the capital base of the business since it loses resources which could have been used to produce more goods"
