question: "1b. Discuss four advantages of a written constitution.",
definition: "A written constitution has the following advantages:",
options: "\
1. Written constitutions are features of the modern state governed on the basis of the provisions of written constitutions. Countries with written constitutions include the United States of America and Ghana under the Fourth Republic.\n\n\
2. Written constitutions make for certainty. This is because the documented provisions create certainly about the basic rules that govern the government of the state. It is a document, thus it is precise and certain, and can be referred to at anytime when there is doubt on what actually the law says on what is the accepted procedure for doing something.\n\n\
3. Protects human rights: Citizens know about their rights and obligations and extent of the powers of the government. Fundamental rights like the right of life, worship, association, etc. are normally entrenched in a written constitution so that a government in power cannot easily change these rights to suit whims and caprices. A constitution also makes it possible for citizens whose rights are being trampled upon to seek redress at the courts. For instance, a person who is detained without any charge and trial can file a wit of Habeas at the High Court.\n\n\
4. A written constitution serves as symbols of statehood. All modern states that gain their independence from colonial rule or states that are making a fresh start after a revolution or Coup de ’tat adopt a written constitution as a mark of statehood; so that they adopt an acceptable political system or form of government. For instance, Ghana adopted a written constitution at the time of her independence from British Colonial rule in 1957. Ghana has also adopted a ne » constitution called the 4th Republic Constitution after the 31st December Revolution.\n\n\
4. Written constitutions determine the organs and institutions and processes of government in a state, whether a country practices unicameralism or bicameralism, federal or unitary form of government depends upon the constitutional arrangement.\n\n\
5. Written constitutions allocate functions and powers to the various organs and institutions of the state. They determine the nature of the relationship between the organs and institutions and between the citizenry. They distribute powers to the three organs of government like the legislature, the executive and the judiciary and also determine the limits of the powers of the institutions. Written constitutions ensure that the interests of minorities especially in federal state are adequately protected since such a constitution spells out clearly the rights of minority groups.\n\n\
6. Written constitutions ensure periodic and peaceful change of government. A written constitution has brought about periodic election which takes place every four years in Ghana. This enables the electorate to vote out a government which is not administering the affairs of the government properly. People have therefore the freedom to choose any political party which they majority consider to have the right calibre of people to administer the affairs of the country. Again the people have the free choice to vote for any eligible member of any political party to be the president of the country."

{
id: "question2b",
question: "2b. Describe four of the roles leaders play in the society.",
options: "\
1. The father / family head exercises his authority over the children, mother and other members who make up the family. The father is also the bread winner of the family, since he provides the material and physical needs of the family.\n\n\
2. In school the teacher acts as the leader over the pupils / students whilst the Headmaster/ Principal etc is the leader for both the teaching and non-teaching staff and pupils / students. For that students do their exercises and assignments at the right time. The Headmaster also ensures that teachers and non- teaching staff also report for duty on time and perform their duty as expected of them.\n\n\
3. Among the students’ population the prefects supervise activities of their respective groups. In school the class prefect is the leader in the classroom. He ensures prompt attendance at class by class teachers and students and also ensures that the classroom environment is conducive for teaching and learning.\n\n\
4. In the community, the chief, his elders, assembly men / women are all leaders who hold important offices in the society and must be obeyed by the people. For example, the chief, who is the leader of his community, exercises his authority in accordance within the limits of the customs and traditions of the people.\n\n\
5. The Nation-The President / Vice, Regional Ministers, Judges, Parliamentarians are all leaders at different levels with different but important role and responsibilities towards their subjects or subordinates.

{
id: "question3",
question: "3. Discuss any four democratic values in our traditional system of government that can be useful to constitutional rule.",
options: "\
1. Constitutionalism though not written: Our traditional system of government is based on constitution though not written down is the form of a written document. Traditional system of government is based on laid down procedures such as conventions, taboos, norms, values, customs and traditions of the people. The lives of the people are governed by these laid down procedures therefore every member of the community is expected to obey them. Failure to obey the customs and traditions of the area may result in the culprit being punished or sometimes burnished from the community.\n\n\
2. System of Arbitration: Our traditional system of government does not rule in an arbitrary manner. It provides for freedom of speech, right to ownership of property etc. The chief, who is the Head of his community, exercises his authority in accordance within the limits of the customs, conventions, taboos and traditions of the area. In any arbitration the chief and his traditional cabinet meet and discuss every issue and ensure that there is amicable settlement of the problem at stake.\n\n\
3. Popular participation in decision making/Open Representative Forum: In the traditional system of government in the small towns and villages they allow a free forum for decision of very important issues affecting their communities etc. In villages gong-gong is beaten to invite people to meet at the meeting ground to deliberate on issues affecting them. Some of these issue may be related to poor enrolment in schools, sanitation, security of the people, teenage pregnancy etc. Sometimes, the chief with his cabinet of elders gather to plan to generate revenue for the development of the area and to find solution to problems facing the community\n\n\
4. Role Traditional cabinet: The traditional cabinet is made up of Council of Elders, Sub-chiefs, Linguists, Queen mothers, etc. Thus the chief rules through traditional cabinet. The traditional cabinet advises the chief and helps in making laws. In the traditional system of government, consensus building is upheld for good governance. Laws are therefore strictly obeyed through the institution of taboos. The chief is, therefore, not a dictator. However, he is the spiritual leader of the society and therefore ensures that libation is poured for the up keep and well being of the society. He also invokes the ancestral spirit and asks for help and support. This position of the chief makes him to be held in high esteem, revered and respected by the council of elders and among the people. Traditional governments therefore affirm the values of majority rule.\n\n\
5. Accountability: In traditional system of government, the chief makes pledges of allegiance or loyalty to the people. The chief is therefore expected to rule within the limits of the customs and traditions of the area. In adjudicating cases, the ruler is expected to be impartial. The chief is, therefore, regarded as the soul or father of the people and must at all times bring the various families or ‘abusua together to assist the council of elders to govern the community to the satisfaction of the people. At an annual festival the chief may give account of his stewardship indicating what projects he has been able to provide for the people in the course of the year and what plans he has for the ensuing year.\n\n\
6. Ascension to the throne/Swearing an oath of office: In the traditional system of government we have the stool for the Akans and skin for Northerners. The process of making a king or chief is through nomination, selection and enstoolment and enskinment. In the traditional government, the chief ascends the throne in accordance with customs of the community. Even though the ruler is selected from an inclusive group by a small group of kingmakers, the public may be given the opportunity to express approval or disapproval of the choice. The chief is not imposed on the people because he is selected by kingmakers and he must be a person of good character and having the characteristics of a chief. If the public disapproves of the choice made the king makers will have to accept the popular decision of the people. He takes an oath of office and consents to govern in the interest of the people. A ruler who falls out of favour may be removed. But he is given the opportunity to respond to charges preferred against him. Since there are laid down rules for changing the government in the traditional system of government no single person can stage ‘Coup d’etat’ to overthrow a traditional government. Before there is any change of government the traditional cabinet in collaboration with the elders of the royal family and the general public have to come to compromise and destoolment charges are heard and debated on by them before destooling the chief. Clearly consensus building has been the basis for traditional government for it incorporates democratic systems, respect for authority and transparency in the governance of the society which can be applied in the modern system of democracy\n\n\
7. Freedom of speech: The traditional system of government provides for some freedom of speech, right to life, right to ownership of property, fundamental human rights etc. The traditional system of government has no organised opposition. For example, decisions-making comes not directly from the chief but in consultation with the council of elders composed of the sub-chiefs, lineage heads and other elders of the chiefdom, who deliberate freely on issues so that whatever decision that comes out is from the cross section of the community."

question: "4a. Identify two responsibilities each expected of a married couple (husband and wife ) for maintaining a good married life.",
options: "\
1. Love for the wife and children: The husband is expected to treat his wife and children with care, love and understanding.\n\n\

5. Ability to cater for the family needs: The husband works hard to get enough money to provide these basic necessities of life like food, shelter, clothing, security, etc. The husband protects the family both spiritual and physical. Because of the physical strength of the husband, he is expected to protect his family against any physical attack or harm by other people. He defends the family members from any outside attacks.\n\n\
6. The Head of the family: The husband is the head and breadwinner of the family; he provides the material needs of the family. As spiritual head of the family, he occasionally pours libation to ask the gods to protect the family. The husband is expected to set good example for the family members to follow. He must be honest, tolerant, fair, firm and truthful in all his dealings with the family members. The husband is also expected to ensure discipline in the family. He should check waywardness among the children and ensure moral training of the children so that they develop good character from undesirable external influences. It is the duty of the father to maintain law and order at home. He therefore settles disputes within the family by solving quarrels between the children and between the children and their mother. He sees to it that there is peace and harmony in the family.\n\n\
6. Sexual Satisfaction/Procreation: The husband satisfies the sexual and other emotional needs of the wife. The husband ensures that her wife gets the sexual satisfaction that she needs so that together with her they produce children into the family. The role of procreation ensures the continuity of the family line. The husband gives love and affection to the family members. He comforts the wife when she is sad and solves her problems to make her happy.\n\n\
8. Financial commitment: The husband provides the financial needs of the family. He is usually the one who pays all the bills, that is, payment of school fees, rent, donations, water and electricity bills. When a member of the family is sick, it is the husband who has to take the one to the hospital and settle the hospital bills. \n\nThe responsibilities expected of a wife to maintain a good married life may be as follows:\n\n\
1. Respect for the husband. The wife is expected to show respect, kindness and obedience lo the husband. The wife must know how to talk to her husband so that there will be happiness in the home. Since children copy the behaviour of their parents there must be mutual respect for each other.\n\n\

3. Faithfulness: The wife must be trustworthy, loyal and capable of managing the finances for the family.\n\n\
4. Be a good house keeper. The wife must cook, wash clothing and provide the health needs of the family. The wife must manage with the house-keeping money to provide food for the family. She must also ensure that her house is clean.\n\n\
5. The wife must be approachable to all family members. The wife must show respect to the man’s in- laws. She must relate very nicely to the man’s relations. When the wife is approachable to all family members, this will bring about happiness in the family.\n\n\
6. Sexual satisfaction: The wife is expected to look to the husband alone for sexual satisfaction. In our traditional society sex is for procreation and not for mere satisfaction. Therefore sexual satisfaction must lead to child bearing which can stabilize the marriage."

question: "4b. Explain four preparations that ought to be made by a man and a woman who are planning to get married.",
definition: "In marriage either the man or woman makes some preparation before the actual marriage ceremony takes place. In the first place, the man informs the parents of his intention to marry his new found woman. After mentioning the names of the girl and their parents, if the man’s family are interested in the bride-to-be they will investigate the background of the bride- to- be and her family. The investigation is to prevent marriage difficulties which the married couple will face in this course of their marriage. The investigation is based on issues concerning the health, that is, whether there is any genetic diseases such as madness, epilepsy, leprosy, and other unacceptable social habits like criminality, stealing, immorality, quarrelsomeness, laziness. etc. The parents would also want lo know the occupational background of the bride- lo be, that is, whether she working or not. The bride- 1o-be’s family will also investigate the background of the man an I his family to ascertain if they have genetic diseases such as madness, leprosy, epilepsy or have criminal records and whether he is lazy or quarrelsome. After investigation, the next preparation is courtship during which the couples study each other. This period of courtship may begin in the form of greetings, giving or asking for gifts by the would-be couples. The character or conduct of the would-be couple is very important since they would want to associate with someone who is respectful, polite in speech, tolerant, humble, obedient, considerate etc. As a result the man and the woman who are planning to get married should know that their relationship is livelong one which must be built on mutual love and understanding. During this time people observe their movements and pass their comments. The man and woman who are planning to get married must be self- supporting, that is, they must be gainfully employed or self-employed. This will help them to earn an income which will enable them to purchase the things they will need before they marry. A gain, if the couples are working before marrying this will help them to rent their own apartment so that they do not become a burden on their parents. When the above preparations have been done, the introductory fee or knocking fee popularly. called knocking at the door is made. It is normally presented to the girl’s family early in the morning. The knocking ceremony follows, when a favourable reply is sent to the man’s family about their son’s intension to marry their daughter. The man’s family presents “Tri nsa” (head wine) to the bride-to-be’s family. The preferred drink is schnapps and is usually accompanied by an amount determined by the bride’s father. The man’s family then presents prescribed items to the woman’s family. This may be referred to as the bride wealth (bride price). The items required or demanded may differ from one local area to the other and may be dependent on the status of the woman or her religious affiliation.",

question: "5a. Define the term socialization.",
definition: "It is the conscious effort to pass on the culture of the society to the individual. It is through this effort that the individual is brought to understand and accept the customs and learns the norms, values, language, skills and beliefs that are essential for a social living. The individual thus becomes socially adapted to his/her environment and an accepted member of the society.",
},


{
id: "question5b",
question: "5b. Explain four different roles played by the family in the socialization process.",
definition: "The family plays the following roles in the socialization process:",
options: "\
1. Provision of physical needs of the child e.g. food, clothing, shelter etc: Children are indeed helpless in providing their own physical needs such as food, clothing and shelter. Any child left to fend for himself/herself is very likely to go way ward. Most of the street children we see on our streets find themselves in this category. It is therefore incumbent on parents who have brought them into this world to provide the physical needs of their children. When a child is well fed, clothed and given a better shelter he will grow up into a well-cared-for child.\n\n\
2. Security and support: The family provides the child a sense of security and belonging and love (hence emotional stability). Children need a great amount of security from the family. The environment in which we live is not wholly pleasant and that parents need to provide conditions that will make their children secured and emotionally stable. It means that children must always be sure that there is somebody to defend and protect them from danger and create a loving atmosphere for them to live in.\n\n\
3. Providing domestic/occupational/skill training: The family must teach and provide opportunities for the child to learn the basic skills for earning a livelihood. Thus this helps to impart vocational skills to the child. Many opportunities therefore abound for the child to explore to acquire a skill for a meaningful livelihood. Parents should therefore expose the child to the rudiments of cooking, extracting palm oil from palm fruits, basket weaving, door mat making, sewing, trading, carpentry, farming etc. By exposing the child to these occupational opportunities he can choose the vocation which will suit him/her and which can be his/her life long occupation.\n\n\
4. Promoting cooperation: The family must help the child to know the need for co-operation and interaction with others within the family and the larger society. Human beings do not live in isolation but in communities based on mutual relationships. Parents therefore need to inculcate in the child the spirit of love. The child must to feel that he is not an island but a member of the larger society in which he finds himself and that together they must forge for a common purpose. He should be able to interact favourably with other members of the society and co-operate with them in any activity so that the desired objectives can be achieved.\n\n\
5. Cultural transmission: The family constitutes the basic unit for imparting the cultural heritage of the society to the child. Parents who are head of family are duty bound to bring up the child to socially acceptable standards. Since every human society has culture parents must make sure that such a culture is imparted to the child through their mode of dressing, talking, respect for elders etc. Again we should make sure that the child is well groomed in his/her culture so that he/she should also pass it on to posterity. Children must not shun their own culture but must be made to appreciate the value and importance of their culture so that they cherish it.\n\n\
6. Moral training: It is the sole responsibility of parents to give the child good character training and moral upbringing. The communities in which we live are made up of people of different shades of characters and moral background. To achieve a good character and moral build up parents must keep constant watch over their children so as to ensure that the children grow up to socially acceptable standards and can differentiate between good and bad. The environment in which the child lives determines its upbringing. If the environment is favourable in terms of social approval, the child will grow to be of good character and if the environmental conditions for the proper development of the child is bad it can affect the child’s later character development. The family should protect the child from peer group pressure and other social vices like stealing, truancy, fighting etc. The family should therefore advise the child to disassociate himself/herself with friends who have bad character. The child should also be advised not to watch sex-related films and violent films, which can easily have an adverse effect on his/her character development.\n\n\
7. Economic co-operation: The family comes together to assist one another. It helps members to organize funerals, pay relatives school fees, hospital bills etc. Family members working in the urban areas also send money for the upkeep of the extended family members in the village.\n\n\
8. Procreation: Procreation or child bearing is also an important role of the family. The family is responsible for producing new members for the society. As the older people die off, young ones must replace them to ensure continuity of the human race, to perpetuate the name of their parents and the family at large."

question: "6a. Difference between formal and informal education.",
options: "\
1. Formal education (Modern) Learning is carried out in specifically built institutions such as classrooms or a place of learning.\n\n\
2. Learning involves two identified parties the teacher and learners. The teacher is trained as a professional teacher and therefore follows a clearly defined course of instruction.\n\n\
3. In formal education what is taught is structured by means of syllabus and time table, work is graded and organized to suit the age and ability of a learner. The teaching which is provided is supervised by professionally trained teachers. An external administrative body called the Ghana Education Service supervises the teaching of teachers.\n\n\
4. Formal education is based on scientific approach to learning. This involves the use of systematic method of observing situations. This step-by- stop approach of observing, classifying and experiencing issues is aimed at gaining and understanding of how things happen. v. One of the parties accepts responsibility of educating the other and he is the teacher. He undergoes special training on his role as to how to teach while the student learns. 6. Formal education is literate oriented. Learners are taught how to read, write and work. Informal education (Traditional) i. Leaning is not structured with defined environment. There are no built institutions, classrooms or a place for learning. ii. Every adult becomes the teacher the father, mother, uncle, aunt and every member in the community is a teacher. 3. Much of the learning is unconscious, informal, unstructured and not in pint oral transmission. Leaning is not structured with syllabuses, timetable and trained teachers.\n\n\
4. Informal education is an unscientific approach and proceeds through real life experiences. The method of teaching is practical as most teaching is done by personal participation, questioning and demonstrations and observation.\n\n\
5. There is no special training for the teachers as pertains in the formal education. Every adult becomes a teacher.\n\n\
6. Every aspect for the physical and social environment is regarded as the place of learning. Information education is therefore characterized by fact-to-face interaction."

id: "question6b",
question: "6b. What four social changes has formal education brought in your community?",
options: "\
1. Events can now be documented: Formal education has brought about enlightenment and helped in mental development of many people. Formal education has helped to produce professionals like teachers, doctors, engineers, geographers, lawyers, accountants, etc. The medium of instruction English language – which is used in all aspects of our lives has helped to document events of the country (that is, the history and geography of the country are all documented in the English language).been developed and improved to match international standard.\n\n\
2. There is the adoption and use of the English language as official language in Ghana. This has become possible because of formal education. The medium of instruction the English language-is used at functions, international meetings and conferences in the country. Infact, it is the official language used in communicating with people in the country,\n\n\
3. Mental liberation: Formal education has made Africans less superstitious, removed prejudices against females, etc. Through formal education, a lot of Ghanaians have been converted to either Christianity or Islam and therefore do not indulge in idolatry and also do not believe in the powers of the traditional gods as sacrosanct. Shrines, sacred groves and other sacred places used as avenues for seeking protection against the forces of darkness, for long life, prosperity etc. have therefore been abandoned. Formal education has also broadened the outlook of Ghanaians and helped them to attain great heights. Many people are now demanding the right to liberty and real freedom. Some cultural practices known to be outmoded and inimical to the development of the society have been completely eliminated or controlled. For example, human sacrifices female circumcision, trokosi etc.\n\n\
4. Nationalist feelings: Formal education has brought cross – cultural understanding. People from different cultural back ground have been brought together. Things are now done at the national levels. Formal education has also helped in exchange of cultural ideas across the country. Formal education has therefore influenced our marriage, food habits, way of dressing, music, dance and other forms of entertainment. Formal education has also helped in improving our cultural heritage for example religion, architecture, dressing, food-habits etc. Many tourist sites have been developed and improved to match international standard.\n\n\
5. Family and Population Control Mechanism: There is a shift or change from the extended family system to the nuclear family system. The extended family no longer acts as security for its members since formal education has led many educated people to leave the rural area for the urban centres to work and occasionally return to the village. The educated people rely on their children and wife that is, the nuclear family, for support and thus weakening the extended family system as support system for people of the same blood relation.\n\n\
6. Elimination of some outmoded cultural practices: Formal education has made the people know the negative effects of some of our cultural practices such as female genital mutilation, trokosi, widowhood rites etc. The trokosi system is a cultural practice which suppresses the growth and realization of God- given human values and right. The practice of widowhood rites is dehumanizing and humiliating to the widow and through formal education many people now understand the need to stop such inhuman cultural practices which violates the rights of women.\n\n\
7. Literacy: Formal education has made it possible for people to read and write. People can now interact with other people in other countries by writing letters. People can also put down historical facts for future reference.\n\n\
8. Cultural adulteration: Formal education has led many people to copy western lifestyles such as dressing, music, dance, marriage etc. In many homes now, speaking English language is more fashionable than the Ghanaian language, making people who can speak English better than their own local languages.\n\n\
9. Enhances social status and mobility: Formal education has brought about social mobility and enhanced social status. It has also made people to acquire academic profession which enables them to seek employment in any part of the country. Academic profession enhances people’s social status as they can climb the social ladder and have social respect.\n\n\
10. There is a shift change from the extended family system to the nuclear family system. The extended family no longer acts as security for its members since formal education has led many educated people to leave the rural area for the urban centres to work and occasionally return to the village. The educated people rely on their children and wife that is, the nuclear family, for support and thus weakening the extended family system as support system for people of the same blood relation,"

definition: "It is the official enumeration of all persons physically present in a country at specified time. It implies the collection, compilation, evaluation, analysis and publication of demographic, social and economic statistics relating to the population.",
},


{
id: "question7b",
question: "7b. Discuss four benefits that your country derives from population census",
definition: "My country, Ghana, derives the following benefits from population census:",
options: "\
1. Population census aids development or economic planning embracing all regions and districts of the country. The government needs to obtain adequate and relevant population statistics of the country for planning purposes. The data will be of great help to the Central, Regional District and Local Authorities in planning their various education, health and other social services. By analysing the results of population census, the government is able to provide social and economic infrastructure like education, health, housing, roads, industries, power, bridges etc. throughout the country on an even basis.\n\n\
2. Population census contributes to the generation of time-series data needed for projects for future dates. The government can plan for future projects like education, health, housing, transportation, industries and other social services for the people. Population census forms an objective basis for the future distribution of a country’s resources to all regions and districts. Revenue allocation among the regions and districts for development programmes is based partly on the population of the regions and districts.\n\n\
3. Population census helps to determine the structure-sex, age youth, women, men, the aged, etc. and how these figures are distributed across the length and breadth of the country. The 2000 population census shows that females constitute 50.0%, which shows a sex ratio of 97.9 males to 100 females. The 2000 population census shows that the age structure is characterized by a large proportion of children( less than 15years) and a small proportion of elderly persons (greater than 64 years). Population data and figures also enable the government to assess the growth rate of the population. If a country’s rapid population growth is due to high birth rate, the government can introduce population control measures like Family Planning which will enable families to space their births and have children when they want them. The government can also formulate policies which will bring about rapid economic development in the form of increased productivity from the agricultural and industrial sectors, which can help to solve the undesirable effects of rapid growth of population like food shortages.\n\n\
4. Population census aids the formulation of policies towards immigration and internal migration. Population data and figures afford governments to know the number of aliens in the country- in line with the foreign policy. This will enable the government to control the influx of especially unskilled and undesirable aliens into the country. Migration from the rural areas in the urban centres accounts for half of urban population expansion. By analyzing the results of population census, the government can control rural-urban migration by establishing rural industries and providing the rural area with social amenities like electricity, pipe-borne water, hospitals, schools, recreational and entertainment facilities.\n\n\
5. Delimitation: The population data and figures provided form the basis for delimitation or breakdown of the country into constituencies, district for administrative purposes etc. especially for election purposes. Results of a population census will assist the government in the demarcation/delimitation of electoral boundaries or constituencies. This will enable the government to know the constituencies needed by each region / district for parliamentary representation. It also determines the population of eligible or qualified voters that could be require] for an election, the Electoral Commission further uses the census figures of various periods to revise the voters register and ensure that those who fall within the voting age are registered.\n\n\
6. Population census helps businessmen/women to plan their activities. Businessmen use population data and figures as a basis for the importation of goods and services. The age composition of a country’s population will determine which items to be imported. If the numbers of working population are many in the country, businessmen/women will import goods like fashionable dresses and shoes, electronics, fridges, cars, TV sets etc needed by the working population. Businessmen and women use the population census to know where demand is high before making investment decisions.\n\n\
7. Foreign countries and other world bodies need information on population data and figure: when planning technical or economic assistance for the country, Many of the aid-giving agencies are influenced by the needs of countries as expressed by the number of people, which also indicate the size of markets and therefore influence foreign investment. Population figures also provide a basis for contributions to such organisation as the UN, ECOWAS and A.U. Population census also forms the basis for the amount of foreign grants, aid and investments flowing to a country.\n\n\
8. Population census gives the total number of and characteristics of persons in every town or village. Population census provides an accurate statistic of the number of people living in the country. This will enable the government to know the characteristics of the people e.g. the size of the family, the age, sex, and occupations of the people and the amount of living space they have and so on. The standard of living in a country is measured with many factors among, which is per capita income. There is the need to divide the total population by the Gross Domestic Product."

question: "8. Explain five factors which the management of a company would adopt to increase productivity.",
definition: "The following are some of the factors which the management of a company would adopt to increase productivity:",
options: "\
1. Laziness, lateness to work, sleeping at work etc waste of working hours on conversation and receiving of visitors etc. are examples of negative work ethics which lead to a loss of several production hours and result in low productivity. To increase productivity of a company management should change radically the above negative work ethics which can hinder its development. For example workers who come to work late or use working hours to converse should be sanctioned for their behaviour.\n\n\
2. Education should be mounted to correct such negative attitudes as laziness, lateness to work, sleeping at work etc waste of working hours on conversation and receiving of visitors. Many workers have negative attitudes to work because they have the impression that additional output or profit the company makes only benefits the management and not the workers themselves. To raise productivity the workers should be educated to correct such negative attitudes as laziness, lateness, sleeping at work etc. Management should organize seminars, lectures, workshops to educate workers on the need to exhibit positive attitudes to work to increase productivity.\n\n\
3. Management should give incentives. Productivity in a company can be increased if high salaries and wages increase the physical welfare of workers. In the private sector because of the high wages offered to workers it induces them to put in more effort thus increasing productivity. Very attractive incentives for workers such as subsidies or free medical care, car loan, housing loans, scholarship schemes, bonuses, transport allowance etc go a long way to boost the morale of the workers and thereby raising their productivity.\n\n\
4. Management should reduce bureaucratic processes. In public companies there are too many rules and regulations or excessive and complicated official routine. This makes simple jobs take a longer time than normal to complete. The result is that a lot of man-hours are lost or wasted through long delays which decrease the amount of work done within a specific time. Management should put effective measures in place to reduce bureaucratic processes which breed corruption among high officials and retard productivity in a company. For example, management can control excessive use of formalities and strict adherence to rules and regulations in companies so that there are no delays in executing management rules and policy.\n\n\
5. There is the need for proper supervision. Management of a company must ensure that supervisors show serious interest in the supervision of their workers to derive maximum productivity from. the work entrusted them. Efficient supervisors should not condone with workers who persistently come to work late or absent themselves from work. Since this behaviour may result in decrease in productivity such workers should be sanctioned and made to report to work early. Again, proper supervision ensures that workers avoid unnecessary loitering and conversation and working lottery during working hours.\n\n\
6. Good employer- employee relationships: The workers productivity can be raised if they are motivated by their management since this will boost their moral. Management must therefore have a cordial relationship with their workers so that they can identify the needs of the workers and satisfy them to reduce apathy and increase their productivity. Workers must at all times feel free to present their problems and requests to management for amicable solution. Workers must avoid any confrontation with management on issues that can be settled peacefully without recourse to strike and lockouts.\n\n\
7. Management should adopt modern machine and technology. In many work places there is lack of modern machines and equipment etc for efficient production. The poor state of machines in companies which often breakdown when output becomes great reduces output. A lot of the machines are old and weak and have to be either serviced repeatedly or replaced. However the absence of funds and the high cost of spare parts or new equipment make it impossible for these items to be purchased by the government to increase output. This situation does not often happen in the public companies, which ensure that machines and equipment are always in perfect condition to increase output. For example, modern machines and technology have made it possible for farmers to have access to better agricultural machinery, such as tractors, planters, ploughs, combine harvesters etc. These machines have contributed greatly to agricultural development when compared simple farm implements like hoe and cutlass which result in low productivity.\n\n\
8. Substitution of capital for labour: To increase productivity in a company management ensures that efficient machines are used to produce goods. For example, robots can be programmed with the help of information technology to perform duties or work, which so many people could have taken such a long time to do which hither too was too difficult and dangerous to do very easily. The use of combine harvesters and tractors enable large tracts of land to be ploughed, planted and harvested while employing few workers. Many companies now use computers for office duties instead of manual typewriters, which can perform very few functions.\n\n\
9. Education Management offer Technical and Professional training to labour to raise its productivity. Training given to technical and professional students equip them with skills that help to increase the productivity of workers. For example, a literate farmer who can read and follow instructions in the application of say, fertilizer and adopt modern methods farming will be able to increase his level of output as against an illiterate farmer who cannot read."
