question:  "1b. Identify any four benefits of oral tradition to a historian. (12 marks)",
definition:  "It is the traditional accounts about the past that are passed on from one generation to another in the form of a story, song, or other forms of music. The benefits of oral tradition to a historian are the following: To begin with, oral tradition helps to confirm archaeological discoveries. The archaeologists need not to take all information from the artifacts and the non-artifacts as valid and conclusive. He has to weigh them against information from oral sources. For example, if coins and cowries are discovered through excavation, there is the tendency to conclude that the people who lived at this place were traders. However, this conclusion could be true or false by comparing it with information gathered from linguist and elders of a community. Also, oral tradition serves as an important source of information in the absence of any other forms of information. In the absence of any other source of information oral traditions act as the source of information for historical writing. Thus in a situation where there are no written records like personal diaries and minutes of meetings, the historians rely solely on oral tradition. Through this source, Africans have been able to keep their history for several years. This became necessary because the art of writing was unknown to Africans until the later part of its history. For example, information about past kings of various kingdoms and history of several villages and clans is provided mainly through oral tradition. Again, it helps to determine historical trends and events. When several oral traditions are compared, historians are able to remove all sorts of biases and inconsistencies in a particular history. This may be so because as information about events passes on from mouth to mouth, they lose their order, names and dates. For instance, different accounts have been given by different members of the same ethnic groups in Ghana concerning their origin, but when these accounts are compared, historians would be able to remove the inconsistencies in the stories. Moreover, oral tradition provides easy access to historical information. Oral source of information are sometimes not difficult to come by since information are simply passed on from one generation to another. People can easily get access to historical information from different oral sources such as storytelling, songs, drum and horn music. For instance, community or stool history can be easily obtained when elders of the community are contacted. Furthermore, it is less expensive way of writing African history. Information is obtained directly from a person without going through books or other sources of history that comes with a cost. For instance, historical information is obtained free of charge from people who are knowledgeable in the subject or the issue under study. Sometimes certain customs are performed by offering a bottle of drink (schnap) to the resource person. This is done just to show appreciation to him. Finally, oral tradition aids archaeologists to locate historical sites. Archaeologists could first rely on oral tradition before they go on to dig up a place for historical facts. It is important to know that, the first hint of history of a people was often provided by oral traditions. Through the historical account given by oral tradition, archaeologists are able to embark on their research work for the needed information on a group of people. This information will reveal the history of a place or region.",

question:  "2b. Highlight any four features of the religious system of ancient Egypt. (12 marks)",
definition:  "Ancient Egypt was one of the world’s oldest civilizations. It was the first kingdom in the ancient world to attain political unity. Religion played an important role in the life of the ancient Egyptian. At the early stage of Egyptian civilization, they were traditional worshippers who observed the following practices; To start with, the Egyptians worshipped several gods (Polytheism). These gods included Re (the sun-god), Hathor (the protectress of the city of the dead), Isis (goddess of fertility), Osiris (god of the dead), Amon-Re of Thebes. The sun became an object of particular adoration. It was therefore represented by several deities. They included Amon Re (the sun god) and Horus (god of the rising sun). All these gods were responsible for specific duties such as ensuring fertility. Also, the Egyptian people brought forth their problems for the gods to solve. Also, Egyptians regarded their Kings as gods. In addition to the other gods, the ancient Egyptians also regarded their Pharaohs as gods in the image of man. The divine god-king was regarded as the intermediary between the forces of nature and man. The god king is believed to possess the power to control the Nile flood so vital to the life of Egypt. Again, the Egyptian gods were often identified with respected animals. Such animals include; hippopotamus, lion, crocodile, vulture etc. These animals were kept in temples and when they died they are mummified and buried in special cemeteries or tombs. Such animals were protected by taboos.This means that it was forbidden to kill them because it would bring bad luck or evil. Another feature of religious system was that they believed in life after death. They believed that the soul returns to the body after death. They believed that a good life on earth would be rewarded with happiness and immortality in the ancestral world. The Egyptians believed that spiritual life continued after death and so they were very careful when preparing the dead for burial. Therefore, the purpose of building the pyramids was to provide comfortable homes for the Pharaohs immortal souls. The belief in life after death in Egypt explains the custom of mummifying the dead. Mummification was a means preserving the body so that the soul could continue to live in it. For this reason, useful goods and precious ornaments were buried with the dead for their use in the ancestral world. Example the pyramid of pharaoh Tutankhamun was rich in gold and precious ornaments. The Egyptian gods were served by an organized body of priests. The priests acted as temple officials and maintained the shrines of the gods. They also performed the daily temple rituals considered necessary for the well-being of the society such as sacrifices to the gods. Sacrifices were laid before the temple priests for the gods before embarking on farming or trading expedition. These priests depended on their services at the shrine centres for their livelihood.",

question:  "3b. In what four ways were the people of Northern Africa affected by the Arab invasion in the 7th century? (3 marks)",
definition:  "From the 7th century AD, North Africa which had come under the influence of Greeks, Carthaginians and Romans was invaded by the Arabs. The Arabs influenced the Berbers in the following ways; To begin with, the Arabs replaced Christianity with Islam. Islam replaced Christianity which had earlier on been introduced by the Romans. The Berbers saw Islamic religion as more tolerance religion to their African traditional beliefs and hence gave their total support to it. For this reason they easily surrendered to the Arabs occupation of North Africa. As a result, Islam came to influence the Berbers culture. They observed the Islamic practices of praying five times a day, alms giving, fasting etc. Also, the Arabs introduced to the Berbers Islamic education. Socially, Islam introduced literacy to the people of North Africa. It was used to educate the people to read and write the Arabic language to enable them read the Quaran and the Hadith. This brought about educated class, some of whom spread Islamic education abroad. The Hafsids also encouraged learning in North Africa by establishing a religious boarding school known as the “Madrasas”. The Islamic education introduced to the Berbers led to production of several Muslim scholars in North Africa such as Leo Africanus, Al- Fazari , Al-Bakri and others. In addition, they also established industries in North Africa. The Arab invasion led to economic transformation of Berber countries. For instance paper mills were set up in Fez and Tripoli. Industries manufacturing pottery product, perfume and soap were established. The citizens as well as the rulers of the Berber communities enjoyed much wealth from this venture. Moreover, the Arabs presence led to the development of trade in North Africa. The Berbers relation with the Arabs also led to the development of trade. Trading activities increased between the Berbers and the Arab countries like Iraq and Syria. North African commodities that were exported included wool, leather goods and cereals. In return, the Berbers also imported jewels, hemp, metal, spices and others. Trade indeed brought much wealth to the Maghrebean states which enabled them to build great and prosperous states. Furthermore, the Arabs also introduced Banking into North Africa. The growth in trade led to the introduction of banking system in North Africa. Banks in Baghdad opened their branches in North Africa. Cheques and letters of credit were later used in North Africa. These facilitated trading activities in the Maghreb. With their presence, the North Africans became Arabised and Islamised. The Berbers of North Africa adopted the Islamic practices and cultures. Some cultures and practices such as dressing, inheritance, marriage, administration of justice and politics were based on the Sharia (the Islamic Holy Law) and the Hadith (the teachings of the prophet). For instance, in terms of dressing, their women begun to wore the loose gowns of the Arabs and put on veils to cover the upper part of their body.",

definition:  "After the invasion of the indigenous people of Northern Ghana the Mole-Dagbani established the kingdoms of Mamprusi, Dagomba, Narumba and Mosi during the fifteenth and sixteenth century. The Mole-Dagbani states trace their origin from the east of Lake Chad. According to their tradition, they were led by their legendary founder Tohajie, the Red Hunter from the Lake Chad region. The movement presumably might have been caused by wars of expansion in the area or population explosion. They later migrated westwards into Zamfara in northern Nigeria and southward to northern part of Ghana (their present home). On their way, they assisted the king of Melle in his wars of conquest and conducted several raids in the region of the Niger Bend. In the cause of their journey their leader Tohajie died. He was succeeded by Gbewa who became king and the leader of the people. Under the leadership of Gbewa, they settled at Pusiga, a village in north-eastern Ghana. Under the leadership of Gbewa, they waged wars of expansion against their neighbours (the indigenous people) and easily defeated them. Their victory in the wars came as a result of certain factors including, the use of centralized government, the superiority of their weapons and the cavalry division in their army. In the end, they conquered the territories extending from Fada N’Gurma in the north, Gambaga in the south and Sansane Mango in the east. After some time, Gbewa died but his eldest child called Yamtori could not succeed him because she was a girl. The king was however, succeeded by his eldest son called Zirile. The death of Zirile brought succession dispute among his surviving brothers, Tohogu the eldest, Sitobu and Mantambu. Tohogu, who should have succeeded him, was opposed by his younger brothers Sitobu and Mantambu. Tohogu was defeated, fled to Gambaga and founded his own kingdom called Mamprugu. His subjects called themselves Mamprusi while he, the paramount chief, took the title of “Nayiri”. Later Sitobu and Mantambu also founded the kingdom of Dagomba and Nanumba respectively. Many years later, the great-grandsons of Widraogo (Yamtori’s son) called Oubri, Rawa and Diaba founded the Mossi states of Wagadugu, Yatenga and Fada N’Gurma respectively. Currently, these states can be found in the Republic of Burkina Faso. It is however, clear from this account that the kingdom of Mamprusi, Dagomba, Nanumba and Mossi are related to each other. They all regarded Mamprugu as the parent kingdom and Gambaga as their spiritual home. For these reasons, the Nayiri headed over all the paramount chiefs of the other kingdoms. As a result, they paid respect by sending annual gift to him and also referring complicated matters to him for his opinion and judgment.",

question:  "5. Identify any five features of trade development in pre-colonial Ghana. (15 marks)",
definition:  "Before the Portuguese established trade links with Ghana, the people of Ghana were already into local and long distance trade. The features of this trade include the following: Firstly, various local and foreign articles of trade were involved in pre-colonial trade in Ghana. Trade in pre-colonial Ghana was centered on goods produced in the various sectors of the economy like agriculture and local industries. Ghanaians produced several varieties of crops like cereals, vegetables, fruits as well as important cash crops like kola nuts, palm oil and others that were offered for exchange for other goods. They also engaged in the exchange of wide range of handicrafts from the local industries. For instance, textiles and metal goods like tools and ornaments were used for trade. Secondly, goods were exchange by means of barter. The nature of trade in Ghana during the pre-colonial era was by the means of the barter. This was a system by which a buyer and seller exchange goods directly without the use of money or currency of any kind. For instance, the coastal people who had fish and salt in large quantities gave some to the inland people who gave them gold dust or gold in return. Also, the existence of long distance trade was an important feature of pre-colonial trade in Ghana. In the pre-colonial days, Ghanaians were not only trading among themselves but also engaged in long distance trading. They traded with people living beyond the borders of Ghana. For instance, kola nuts were exported from the central forest region of Ghana through Gonja to the Hausa lands. These were exchanged for leather goods textiles and iron goods from Hausa land. In addition, Ghanaians traded with Ivory Coast and Benin. For example “Quaqua” cloth was obtained from Ivory Coast. Trade with these areas was carried on by canoes which were manufactured at Elmina and Takoradi. Foot paths and waterways were used for trade. Some rivers in Ghana were used as commercial highways for internal trading. For instance, the Volter River served as a useful trade route for people. It was navigable for canoes as far up as Krakye from where the journey was continued by land to Salaga. However, much of the country’s trade was in fact carried along bush paths. Among the major foot paths across the country were the Cape Coast-Kumasi route, the Assin Path which went up to Begho through Tekyiman and Wenchi. Another important feature of pre-colonial trade was the collection of taxes and tolls. Taxes in the form of import and export duties were paid by the Ghanaian traders at the various market centres or trading posts. They sometimes also pay tolls to some traditional rulers to be allowed a passage through their territories to the trade centres. These monies were used for the development of the states or the towns. The use of porters, guides and beast of burden for trading activities in Ghana. There were people who assisted the traders as porters or carriers from one point to the other in cause of their journey to the trade centres for a fee. Others also served as guides who directed the traders on the route to the market centres. Also, beasts of burden such as donkeys were sometimes used to convey the commodities to and from the various trade centres.",

question:  "6. Outline five effects of the British conquest of Ghana. (3 marks)",
definition:  "After the declaration of the Gold Coast as British colony in 1874, the British gradually extended their political control over all the territories of modern Ghana. The colonial rule established by the British in Ghana brought about the following effects upon the nation. To begin with, colonial rule led to the introduction of modern transportation system in Ghana. The colonial administration worked very hard to improve the infrastructural situation in the country. Thus, they constructed several railway lines, roads, ports and harbour. The construction of these amenities made the distribution of goods and services easier for Ghanaians and the British as well. For instance, the railway line from the port of Sekondi to Tarkwa was started in 1898 and reached it destination in 1901. Also some of the early roads built in the country were Accra to Kyebi, Accra-Dodowa, Winneba-Swedru etc. Another effect of colonial rule in Ghana was the spread of European culture and civilization among Ghanaians. The colonial system steadily replaced Ghana’s cultural institutions with the western cultures and values. Ghanaians were made to disregard their rich cultural heritage such as dance, music, mode of dressing, food, names, language etc. They however, developed interest in the western cultures by wearing European cloths, performing European dance and music, accepting European names and the use of European language. Again, colonial rule caused the decline of many local industries in Ghana. Traditional industries like pottery, carving, blacksmithing, cloth weaving and dying also declined due to the importation of European goods. This was so because the colonial rule which was introduced in Ghana by the British paid more attention to European produced goods to the neglect of the development of local ones. Also, Ghanaians developed the attitude of having preference for European manufactured goods as against the locally manufactured ones. This led to the collapse of many local industries in Ghana due to low patronage. It brought to an end the independence of the traditional. Empires, kingdoms and states. Asante, Denkyira, Akwamu, Ga-Adangbe, Mole-Dagbani and the Ewe states were all brought under the British colonial rule. By this the authority of the chiefs to control their states were taken from them leading to the fall of these states and kingdoms. Thus, the colonial rule changed the course of the political history of Ghana. Colonial rule led to the spread of western education in Ghana. With the help of the missionaries, several schools were established during the colonial regime especially around the coastal areas. For instance, Philip Quaque, the first African priest of the Church of England established a school in Cape Coast for training of mulatto children who were growing in large numbers. The colonial government also established elementary schools in few places like Accra, Kumasi etc. They also established their first secondary institution Achimota School in 1927. Some vocational and technical institutions were established in places like Kyebi, Manpong, Asuansi etc. To promote higher education in Ghana, the government established the University College of Gold Coast in 1948. The colonial rule aided the spread of Christianity by protecting the missionaries. The Europeans through their Christian Missions introduced Christianity to Ghanaians and also helped with the spread of the religion. The British authority in Ghana aided the spread of Christianity in Ghana by ensuring maximum protection for the Missions that operated in the country. The European Missions that operated in Ghana during the British rule were the Wesleyan Missionary Society, the Basel Mission, the Roman Catholic Mission etc. As the British authorities promoted law and order in the Ghanaian communities, the missionaries enjoyed peaceful atmosphere to embark on evangelical works leading to the establishment of several churches in Ghana.",

question:  "7. Highlight any five ways in which Western education promoted nationalism in Ghana. (15 marks)",
definition:  "Nationalism is the consciousness or awareness by the people of the same state and desire for freedom from colonial rule. Nationalism in Ghana started in the 19 ^ m century when a few educated people began protest against the activities of colonialism. The idea of nationalism in Ghana was promoted by western education through the following means; Firstly, knowledge acquired from western education made people aware of the colonial exploitation in Ghana. Education equipped Ghanaians to appreciate more fully the political and economic injustices inherent in the colonial system. Having realized the massive exploitation of the country’s resources such as timber, gold, bauxite etc., the educated Ghanaians became increasingly dissatisfied with the colonial system and led nationalist movements against it. An example of such movements was the Aborigine’s Right Protection Society. Secondly, western education enabled Ghanaians to acquire the knowledge of writing to communicate to the masses against colonial domination. The print media such as the Accra Evening News and Cape Coast Daily Mail made people aware of the negative activities of the colonial regime which they stood against it. Also, the expansion of literacy enabled the people to read and learn from books, newspapers and radio the happenings within and outside their own country. Reading news about former British colonial territories such as India and Pakistan inspired their struggle against the British colonial oppression. Again, western education promoted the formation of political parties by the educated class to agitate for self-rule. In 1947, the educated class made up of Paa Grant, J. B. Danquah, R. S. Blay, R. A. Awoonor Williams, Edward Akufo Addo, William Ofori Atta formed the first political party in Ghana, the United Gold Coast Convention (U.G.C.C). The party was formed with the basic aim of ending colonial rule in Ghana. In 1949, the Convention People’s Party was also formed in Accra under the leadership of Dr. Kwame. Nkrumah, to support the agitation for self-rule. Moreover, western education enabled the educated class to organize rallies and symposia to criticise the colonial regime. Having acquired much knowledge through western education, the educated class in Ghana organized rallies and symposia to air their views publicly against foreign rule. At their rallies and symposia the nationalist movement” spoke against the social, economic and political injustices in the system and demanded from government the necessary reforms to address their concerns. These educated people who have had their training overseas in the same centres of learning as the Europeans, were convinced that the African was in no way inferior to the whites and for that matter spoke against colonialism and its activities at such rallies and symposia. The educated people formed trade unions in their respective work places that promoted nationalism in Ghana. The trade unions led by the educated class also promoted nationalism in Ghana as they fought to bring to an end the social and economic injustices in the public service as well as the trade sector. These injustices include the domination of the economy by foreign companies who dictated the prices of both export and import goods. Also, the discrimination against Ghanaians in the public services became a matter of concern to the trade unions. The Ghanaian trained Clergymen and the mission schools used the church to preach against colonialism in Ghana. The Ghanaian trained ministers and evangelists preached about equality of all men before God which exposes the oppressive nature of colonialism. This encouraged the masses to join hands with the elite in the nationalist struggle to kick against colonialism.",

question:  "8b. Outline any four social and economic developments in Ghana under the government of the National Liberation Council (N.L.C) (12 marks)",
definition:  "The government of the National Liberation Council (N.L.C) was set up after the overthrow of the C.P.P government in 1966. It was the first military government in Ghana led by General J. A. Ankrah. Upon assumption to office, several social and economic interventions were put in place by the government to improve the lives of the people. In the first place, the N.L.C provided pipe-borne water and electricity to the rural areas in Ghana. The N.L.C embarked on water and electrification projects by providing good drinking water and electricity to rural areas which obtained less attention during the Nkrumah regime. All important social amenities had been concentrated in the urban areas leading to the increase in migration of people from the rural areas to urban centres. Secondly, the N.L.C. introduced measures to improve education in Ghana. The introduction and standardization of fees in the educational sector was one of the policies adopted to improve education in Ghana. Boarding fees were not to exceed GHC 41.60 a term, while fees for day students were not to exceed GHC11.00 a term. Textbooks fees were also introduced into schools, contrary to Nkrumah’s free education scheme. The government also ensured that scholarships were awarded on merit. As a result, scholarships enjoyed by some 877 Ghanaian students in Britain and U.S.A were withdrawn in October 1966. Again, with the aim of raising the standard of education in Ghana, the N.L.C either closed down or converted some teacher training colleges to secondary schools. In addition, the government improved health facilities in the country. The N.L.C government improved the health sector by establishing clinics and health posts in some villages and cities in the country to boost up health delivery. They also continued with importation of foreign drugs for treatment of deseases like malaria and others. Another social intervention was the setting up of centre for civic education in Ghana. The N.L.C set up the centre for civic education to educate Ghanaians to understand and appreciate their civic rights and responsibilities as citizens. This was geared towards helping Ghanaians to appreciate the state of affairs at the time and make collective effort to deal with them. The centre, headed by Dr. K. A. Busia, organized open lectures throughout the country with a view of instilling in Ghanaians the ideals of selfless public service, accountability, tolerance, forgiveness and self-help. Again, the N.L.C appealed to friendly countries and international bodies for financial assistance. Favourable response came from United State, Great Britain, West Germany and Canada. For instance, U.S.A presented 41,000kg of powdered milk, 140, 000 cutlasses and 100,000 bags of corn for distribution to farmers. They also contracted loans with the International Monetary Fund (I.M.F) and the World Bank. The I.M.F gave Ghana loan of 16.5 million in 1966. In December the same year, it again gave Ghana a loan of two million. The money was to be used in paying arrears of short-term trade bills accumulated by the government. Furthermore, the N.L.C government devalued the cedi. In order to strengthen the economic gains achieved by 1967, the government devalued the cedi. The aim was to improve the economic situation by exporting more goods and importing less. More so, the devaluation was done to attract ore foreign monies into the country and also to stop smuggling and black marketing. However, the devaluation brought hardship upon the people. As a result, salaries and wages were increased by 5% as a means to correct the hardship which resulted from the devaluation of the cedi. The N.L.C adopted measures of reducing government expenditure. In view of this, government ministries, embassies and administrative districts were re-organized. With this, the government ministries were reduced from 32 to 17 and the districts from 167 to 47. Also, there was reduction on Ghana’s foreign missions by 40 %. They increased the Producer price of cocoa to encourage farmers to produce more. The price of cocoa was initially increased from $4.00 to $4.8 by the N.L.C government. However, before the end of the regime in 1969 the price of cocoa had been raised further to $8.00. This was part of the numerous agricultural schemes adopted by the government to encourage farmers to produce more.",

question:  "9. Identify any five factors that motivated Ghana to join the organization of African Unity (OAU). (15 marks)",
definition:  "The O.A.U was a league of African independent states formed in 1963 at Addis Ababa. Ghana, a member of the organization at birth was motivated to join because of the following reasons; To begin with, Ghana joined the organization because of the desire to help their African neighbours to gain independence from colonial rule. Ghana under the leadership of Dr. Nkrumah joined the organization because he wanted an independent Ghana to help liberate the entire African continent from colonial rule. It is for this reason that Dr. Nkrumah declared that “the independence of Ghana is meaningless unless it is linked with the total liberation of the African continent. In view of this, the conference of independent African states was organized in Accra to decide on workable arrangements for helping fellow Africans still subject to colonial rule. Also, Ghana joined the organization because of her desire to associate or unite with independent African states. Dr. Nkrumah, Ghana’s first president had the burning desire to bring African states together as one to foster political and economic growth. Therefore, Ghana joined the organization to guard against division of Africa into small states hostile to one another. Dr. Nkrumah was of the view that unity is strength and that Africa can forge ahead in terms of development only when they are united. For this reason, Ghana played a pivotal role as a founding member of the organization. She hosted the African Conference in April 1958 and the All-African People’s Conference in December 1958. She was among the 32 nations that signed the O.A.U charter in Addis Ababa. In addition, Ghana wanted to be part of this organization that planned to speak with one voice in international forums. She joined the organization with the hope of establishing a platform through which Africans will speak with a common voice about the socio economic and political development on the African continent. Dr. Nkrumah believed that joining this political union to speak with one voice was the way forward to destroy the activities of the imperialist whom for a long time has been the enemy of progress for the African continent. It is for this and many other reasons that Dr. Nkrumah pushed for continental union government that will speak with one voice in international forums hence the formation of the O.A.U. Furthermore, Ghana wanted to derive political, diplomatic and economic benefits from the organization. Ghana under the leadership of Dr. Nkrumah joined the organization to promote diplomatic and economic co-operation between her and its neighbours on the continent. This explains why Dr. Nkrumah played a key role in the formation of the organization to establish trade links and friendship ties with other African nations. Politically, Dr. Nkrumah joined the organization to enable him push for the continental union government which has been his greatest dream for the continent. Moreover, Ghana wanted to end colonialism and neo-colonialism in Africa. Ghana joined the organization to provide aid and support to the Liberation Movements in countries that were still struggling for their freedom from the colonial rule. It was through such assistance that Guinea Bissau, Mozambique, Angola and Zimbabwe achieved independence. It was also the aim of Ghana under the dynamic leadership of Dr. Nkrumah to prevent foreign countries from interfering with internal affairs of African nations that motivated him to be part of the organization. Ghana wanted to promote and participate in sporting activities organized by the union. Ghana joined the organization to be able to participate in the sporting activities organized for its members to promote cordial relationship among one another. Dr. Nkrumah at the time believed that such friendship relationship will promote economic growth among member nations. Thus, Ghana participated in many sporting events organized among African nations such as the African Cup of Nations and All-African Games.",
