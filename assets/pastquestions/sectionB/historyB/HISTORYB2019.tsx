question:  "1. In what five ways can linguistic studies help in the reconstruction of Ghanaian history? (15 marks)",
definition:  "Linguistics is the scientific study of the origin, structure and changes of language. Linguistic studies has indeed contributed towards the reconstruction of Ghana’s history in diverse ways. These include the following; To start with, linguistic evidence helps to trace the origin of people. Linguist evidence enables one to find or trace the original homes of several ethnic groups through comparism of language. Similarities in language type has helped traced the origin of people. For example, studies conducted into Bantu and West African languages have revealed that the Bantu speakers of Eastern and southern Africa originated from Benue River valley in Eastern Nigeria. Also, the migration of the Ewe from their original home (Ketu) to their present location in Ghana was revealed by linguistic studies. It also gives evidence on places of contacts among different ethnic groups. Linguistic evidence has helped revealed different periods and place of contacts among several ethnic groups in Africa. For instance, the Ewe contact with the people of Notsie currently in the Republic of Togo has been confirmed through linguistics evidence. The Guan contact with the Gonja in the North also emanated from linguistic evidence. Also, the existence of common words between ethnic groups who are not related point out to the fact that the two had come into contact along the way. Such contacts usually bring about new ideas and vocabularies. For example, Ga words like “asafoatse”, “awula”, “abotare”, “anokware”, “suban” etc are evidence of their contact with the Akan. Again, linguistic helps to determine similarities and differences in languages. Through linguistics evidence historians are able to determine the similarities and differences in languages of some ethnic groups in Africa. Indeed, linguistic helps to established earlier languages and the ones that developed from them. This can serve as proof of linkage to a particular ancestry or not. It can also help to show the adoption of new ideas and vocabularies by a group of people. An example is the Akan words in Ga language such as “abotare”, “Anokware”, “Suban” etc. In addition, linguistic evidence has helped identify related ethnic groups in Ghana. It helps in identifying people into various ethnic groups. For instance, linguistic has helped to. group people into various ethnic groups like the Ewe, Akan, Ga, and Adangbe based on their language. Also, the Bantu speakers of Kiswahali, Kikuyu, Luganda and Shona of Eastern and Southern Africa can be identified as related ethnic groups according to their parent language Bantu. It helps to confirm or verify the authenticity of historical accounts from other sources of history. Linguistic has contributed immensely towards the reconstruction of African history by confirming the traditions related to the origin of many ethnic groups given by other sources such as oral tradition, archaeology, ethnomusicology etc.",

question:  "2. Highlight any five features of the economy of the Swahili people. (15 marks)",
definition:  "Swahili is the most widely spoken Bantu language in the Southern and Eastern Africa today especially in Zanzibar and Tanzania. The Swahili had a vibrant economy which rested on the following; In the field of agriculture, the Swahili practised crop cultivation and produced food for domestic consumption. This means the people produced food crops on small scale to satisfy their domestic needs. As gardeners they grew vegetables, lemons, bananas, oranges, sugar canes, and millet as their staple food. These varieties of food crops made them healthy and boosted the economy of the Swahili kingdom. They also engaged in domestication of farm animals. The Swahili kept domestic animals for domestic use. The Swahili kingdom had suitable vegetation that supported domestication of different kinds of farm animals. They reared animals like cattle, sheep, and fowls. As craftmen, the skin of the animals was used for leather works. Fishing was another agricultural activity practised by a section of the Swahili population. The people who lived along the coast engaged in fishing as a means of livelihood. They used canoes, hook and lines, fishing nets and fish traps for their fishing activities. The Swahili engaged in foreign rade. The Swahili played the role of middlemen in the trade between the Swahili coast, india and China. Cities like Kilwa, Malindi, and Mombasa became the major entry ports (collecting and distributing centres) of the trade. They received manufactured goods such as cotton and silk cloth, beads, spears, knives and others as they exported goods like gold, ivory and wax. The Swahili kings imposed taxes on traders to raise revenue for the state. The Swahili Kings (Sultans) derived much revenue from duties charged on goods. The tariffs were imposed on both import and export goods. This brought much wealth to the kings which they used for the administration of the kingdom. For instance, out of the tax revenue, the Swahili kings were able to establish strong military for defensive and offensive purposes. The Swahili were also knowledgeable in metal technology. Iron ore was mined in the Sofala Mountain for export. As a result, Iron technology was common among the Swahili people. For instance, according to Al Masudi, the Swahili people wore iron ornaments which were made by local craft men. They also learnt the use of bronze and silver to manufacture goods by the 15th century. Some of these items include: bronze chairs, silver sheath swords and silver coins. The Swahili were also well versed in copper and gold technology. They minted copper in Kilwa and Zanzibar.",

question:  "4b. Highlight any four ways in which European presence affected political development in southern Ghana up to 1900 AD. (12 marks)",
definition:  "The arrival of the Europeans in Ghana brought about certain political influence upon the Ghana. The European presence in Ghana caused increase in inter-ethnic wars. Inter-ethnic wars in Ghana intensified with the supply of arms and ammunitions by the Europeans. The period between 1500 and 1900 saw the rise of inter-ethnic conflicts in Ghana. The various states in Ghana engaged themselves in series of wars. For instance in 1659, Denkyira was engaged in wars to free herself from Adansi rule. In 1701, Asante also fought and defeated Denkyira. Also the wars between Akim and Akwamu ended up withthe fall of the mighty Akwamu Empire The European presence caused the competition to control economic resources which led to political rivalry. Trading with the Europeans led to the development selfish interest of some powerful states to control places of economic importance. This was to ensure that they make a lot of profit from the European trade. However this unhealthy competition led to political conflicts between many states in Ghana. For instance, the struggle to control the gold mines at Abonse led to the long period of conflict Akwamu and Ga-Adangbe. Also, from 1659-1730, Akyem and Akwamu engaged in relentless rivalry for control of the rich gold resources of the Birim Valley. The European presence led to their direct interference in local politics. The inter-ethnic conflicts in Ghana caused insecurity along the coast. Many human lives and villages were destroyed while trade was also disrupted. To ensure sanity and also promote trade at the coast of Ghana, the Europeans began to interfere in the local politics of the people. The Europeans interference in the local politics of Ghana was undertaken by European leaders like Sir Charles McCarthy (1822-1824), Sir George Maclean (1830-1843) and Commander Hill (1843). For instance, by interfering in local politics, McCarthy sought to share the judicial authority of Ghanaian rulers. He did this by establishing two types of courts, a criminal court and petty debt court. The European presence led to the signing of the Bond of 1844 by Commander Hill. This was a treaty signed between the rulers of the southern states and the British Governor (Commander Hill). On 6th of March 1844, Commander Hill assembled some seven rulers of the southern states and signed a treaty with them. The chiefs who signed the bond were those of Denkyira, Abora, Assin, Anomabu, Domenasi and Cape Coast. Among the reasons for the signing of the Bond was that he wanted to regularize the British relations with the people of Ghana. Also, the British wanted their law to be recognized and implemented successfully in southern Ghana. Again, Commander Hill wanted to maintain justice and peace along the coast. The European presence led to British-Asante wars. The European presence resulted in clashes between the Asante and the British over the control of southern states. On several occasions from 1811 to 1874 the Asante came into a head-on collisior, with the British forces in the Gold Coast. The first Brtish-Asante war occurred in 1824, when the British forces were defeated and the governor Sir Charles MacCarthy was killed. However, in 1826 and again in 1874, the British dicisively defeated Asante in the Dodowa and the Sargrenty Wars respectively.",

question:  "5. Outline any five ways by which the Missionaries spread Christianity in Ghana. (15 marks)",
definition:  "The European missionaries began their missionary activities in Ghana in the 15th century with the main objective of converting people to Christianity but ended up with several impacts upon the Ghanaian people. To begin with, the Missionaries established churches in Ghana to spread Christianity. Evangelization wasembarked upon by the missionaries in order to convert Ghanaians to Christian faith. They were able to achieve this through the preaching of the gospel to the people. In the end, they were able to persuade many people and converted them into Christianity. They built churches all over the country where they gathered to worship God. The missionaries also established seminaries and theological institutions in the country for the training of their evangelists. Another way in which the Missionaries spread Christianity was through the establishment of schools. Until almost the end of the colonial period, education was largely in the hands of the Christian-Missions. The missionaries laid effective foundation for formal education in Ghana. They established elementary and second cycle educational institutions in the country to help achieve their major aim of spreading Christianity to the people. For instance, the Basel Mission began to promote elementary education from 1837 when it opened boy’s and girls’ schools at Akropong-Akwapim. Promoting second cycle education, they established the Presbytarian Boy’s Secondary School in Odumasi. Also, the Wesleyan Mission promoted elementary education in Ghana by establishing schools in Cape Coast. On second cycle education, they established Mfatsipim School in 1876 in Cape Caost. Again, The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (Anglican) also founded Adisadel College in 1910. Again, they Produced literacy works to help spread Christianity in Ghana. The Europeans and a few educated Ghanaians began to produce literacy works in some Ghanaian languages. The writing of Ghanaian languages by the missionaries also contributed to the social upliftment of Ghanaians. Example, Rev. Johann Zimmermann produced a Ga dictionary, Ga bible and Grammar book. Also, Rev. Johann Christaller produced similar work in Twi speaking languages. These works were done with the motive of helping to easily spread Christianity among the Ghanaian people who made use of the books. In addition, through the establishment of medical facilities missionaries promoted the spread of Christianity. The Christian Missions in Ghana improved the health service in the country. They did this by providing good drinking water in the rural areas as well as the main towns. The missionaries constructed wells and pipe-borne water in many places which drew the people’s attention to the good works of the Missions. These were made to improve the health needs of the people, especially those in the rural areas. They also established clinics and health posts in some villages and towns as well as encouraging their converts in the Salem communities to observe proper hygienic practices to avoid diseases. The introduction of new crops by the Missions helped spread Christianity in Ghana. The missionaries also introduced new crops such as coffee, mango, ginger, and cocoa for the benefits of the people. The introduction of the cash crops to Ghanaian farmers helped to raise their standard of living. Christian converts were encouraged to engage in the production of these crops to be sold to the European trading companies in order to make a living. Aside their intention of promoting better living conditions for the Christian converts, the missionaries also hoped to promote the production of the needed raw materials for their home industries for production. New farming implements and techniques were also introduced.",

question:  "6b. Outline any four roles played by George Maclean in the growth of British influence in Ghana. (12 marks)",
definition:  "In 1830, Maclean was appointed president of the British Company of Merchants to take over the British possessions in Ghana. He arrived in Cape Coast to assume office on 19th February 1830. He however, succeeded in establishing British influence in Ghana through the following means; Firstly, Maclean established court of justice in some important coastal towns to try cases. George Maclean maintained justice by appointing magistrates to Dixcove, Anomabo, and other places where he had established the British courts. He supervised their work through regular visits. The courts of local chiefs and people were also visited to ensure proper trial of cases. The chiefs and people could appeal to his court. Fines and imprisonment were penalties imposed on the guilty ones. Also, Maclean helped settle inter-state disputes among the people of southern Ghana. Upon assumption to office, George Maclean arrogated to himself the authority to settle disputes among the southern states. For instance, he settled disputes between Wassaw and Denkyira and placed a fine on the Denkyira chief, Kwadjo Tsibu who he blamed for the fight. He also settled the conflict between Akwapim ar. Krobo In 1833. Also in 1836 and 1838, he attempted to settle an old dispute between Upper and Lower Wassa. Again, he signed the Tripartite Treaty of 1831 which brought peace between southern and Asante states. Maclean made a tripartite treaty in 1831 and used diplomacy to have it signed by Asante, the Coastal States and the British themselves. Among the terms of the treaty is that Asante granted the independence of their former vassal states south of the river Pra. In addition, Asante accepted to deposit 600 ounces of gold and hand over two princes of Asante as security in Cape Coast. However, on the part of the Coastal States, they also agreed to make the trade routes open and free to all people who engaged in lawful traffic. Maclean also encouraged missionary activities during his era. The Society for the Propagation of Gospel (S.P.G), the Wesleyan and the Basel (Presbyterian) missionaries were given maximum encouragement to expand western education and other social services to promote British influence in Ghana. Thus, several churches including Methodist, Presbetarian and Roman Catholic churches were established in places like Cape Coast, Akropong, Accra, Kumasi and other places. He established a police system to maintain peace and order. An effective police system was established to maintain peace and order along the coast. About 60 local people were recruited as the initial police officers who were stationed at a number of posts set up in the Southern states. People who engaged in all forms of offences were arrested and punished.",

question:  "8. Identify any five factors which made Ghana the first British colony in West Africa to achieve independence.",
definition:  "Ghana was the first sub-Saharan African nation to achieve independence from colonial rule Her success story was as result of; The role played by the nationalist movements formed in Ghana. In an attempt to assert their fundamental human rights and freedom from colonial rule the educated people in Ghana organized themselves into pressure groups. Among the pressure groups formed were the Aborigines Right Protection Society, The National Congress of British West Africa, The Gold Coast Youth Conference etc. These movements led series of nationalist agitations in Ghana which forced the British colonial government to grant independence. The existing political parties fought hard for the independence of Ghana. The establishment of the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC), the first political party in Ghana and other political parties like the Convention People’s Party (CPP) changed the face of political agitations in Ghana. The agitation by these political groups was centered on seeking total independence instead of mere reforms which was much sort after by the early nationalist groups. The agitation for political independence was intensified with the establishment of political parties. This is because political actors like Dr Nkrumah made people believed that the black man is capable of managing his own affairs. The role played by the newspapers helped Ghana to achieve independence. The newspapers in Ghana made the people aware of the evils of colonialism and the need to attain self-government. The newspapers like the Evening News, Morning Post, Ashanti Pioneer and Gold Coast Observer openly criticised the decisions and policies of the colonial government which paved the way for independence in Ghana. Ghana became independent because of the high numbers of educated people and the rising number of the middle class of people. The educated and the middle class of people such as contractors and business men persistently criticised the activities of the colonialist. The discrimination against the educated class as the colonialist denied them the chance to play any significant role in the administration of their own country generated series of agitations leading to independence. Ghana had an economic advantage as compared to the other West African countries by the end of the World War II. This economic advantage came in the form of infrastructural development in Ghana. Ghana by the end of the Second World War had good roads, railway networks and deep harbour (the Takoradi harbour). These infrastructural developments in Ghana at the time resulted in the rise of middle class business men and contractors who played significant role in the fight for Ghana’s independence. The absence of intense ethnic diversity and disputes in Ghana contributed to independence. The ethnic groups in Ghana, especially the Akan who constituted 45% of the population after some time realised that the common enemy was the colonialist. As a result, ethnic groups in Ghana managed to end the wars among themselves. Indeed, people from different tribes came together to form the early nationalist movements and political parties who together fought for the independence of the country.",
