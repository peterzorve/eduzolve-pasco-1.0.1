definition:  "The West African Sudanese established several great empires such as Ghana, Mali, Songhai, Kanen-Bornu Empire and the Hausa states. They had a well-organized political system with the following features; They established a centralized monarchical system of government. The political organization of all the western Sudanese states was monarchical. The rulers were regarded as sacred or divine. They served as intermediaries between their subjects and the ancestors as well as the gods. During special occasions like annual festivals, the kings sat in state to receive homage from their people. Sub-chiefs also renewed their allegiance by swearing the oath of the rulers and people. They had a council of ministers appointed by the king. A council of ministers assisted the king to govern in all the western Sudanese states. The ministers were made in charge of specific departments. For example; in Songhai the commander of the Navy was known as “the hi-ko” also the commander of the army was “the dyina-koy”. The ministers and interpreters were mainly Muslim literates. To ensure effective work the ministers were paid salaries. Some were given land and other gifts. They created provincial administration. The western Sudanese rulers established provincial administration headed by governors appointed by the king. They were to administer the affairs of the various provinces or the metropolitan part of their empires. The governors were people from the royal family or former generals. They performed the duties of maintaining law and order and collection of taxes. The provinces were subdivided into a number of districts. The districts comprised a number of villages. The districts were headed by the District Chiefs while the individual villages were ruled by village chiefs. The administration of conquered states was in two folds. The natural rulers who submitted without any strong resistance were allowed to rule their subjects but were made only to pay annual tribute. But states that proved stubborn during conquest had rulers appointed for them. This was the case in ancient Ghana and Mali. In ancient Ghana and Mali, princes of vassal or conquered rulers were taken away to serve at the king’s palace. This was to ensure loyalty and regular payment of tribute.",

definition:  "This is the gathering of historical facts and events of the past and present from written records or documents. The following are the reasons for the use of written document as a source of history; Firstly, they are the most effective and efficient means of keeping records of events. Historians obtain information about the achievements and failures of important people, communities, states and kingdoms. Information about great men and women in our society can be obtained from books such as pamphlets, magazines and others. For instance, information about the nationalist leaders such as Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, J.B Danquah and others could be obtained from several history books such as “A History Of Ghana” written by F. K. Buah, “Topics in West Africa History” written by Adu Boahen. Also, documentary sources give more detailed information. Documentary sources provides dates which remain unchanged for several years. This helps one to find date and time of particular history or event. More reliable names of people and other participants as well as dates of important events are normally written in documents which are kept for years. This information are normally lacking in oral tradition and archaeology. They also give illustrations through pictures, maps and diagrams. In addition, documentary sources help easy spread of information. Documentary information can be found in books that can be kept for ages and can also be carried easily from one place to another. They can even be posted from one country to the other. People can easily access information by reading from newspapers, journals etc. Thus, information is made available to people without much difficulties. This makes documentary history more reliable than oral tradition and archaeology. Again, it also helps to crosscheck information obtained from other sources. It serves as a means of finding out the accuracies and consistencies of information given by the other sources such as oral tradition, archaeology etc. For Example, oral information and archaeological findings could all be written down and cross-check at later date. Documentary sources help to do away with exaggeration and information could be cross-checked and subject to recounting over a period of time. For instance, where minutes of meetings have been recorded they become impossible for anyone to change any part of such document without detection. This offers a high degree of reliability as a source for historical writing. It encourages people to do further research. When researchers find some mistakes or inaccurate information in a written source or any other sources they become more interested in conducting further inquiries to find out the real truth. Thus, they help to discover more and reliable information about the topic. Written documents encourage people to do continuous research into important issues and events since they can easily get access to information in written books from libraries and other sources.",

definition:  "Narmer became the first monarch of Egypt when he successfully united the two separate kingdoms of Upper and Lower Egypt and became the sole ruler. Under his leadership, he made certain remarkable achievements including the following: To begin with, Narmer brought Lower and Upper Egypt together around 3100 BC. Around 3100 BC, the towns which had developed on either side of the Nile Valley united to form two main kingdoms i.e. Lower Egypt which extended from the shores of the Mediterranean to the apex of the Nile Delta and Upper Egypt from the Nile Delta to Aswan. As time went on the two kingdoms were unified as one kingdom under Pharaoh Narmer, ruler of Upper Egypt as the first monarch. Also, for effective administration of Egypt, Narmer appointed a Vizier. The vizier was a sort of prime minister who was the next in command of the political ladder. He was in charge of secular matters. He tried cases, heard appeals and appointed magistrates. He was also responsible for the upkeep of roads and building, the police force and the army garrisons in Egypt. Again, he appointed Scribes. These were both military and civilian scribes who were trained in the skill of administration. The scribes kept accounts and copied documents. Narmer divided the kingdom in:o provinces and districts. Since the Egyptian kingdom was too large, it was divided into provinces and various sub-districts. Initially, the kingdom was divided into 38 districts but later, was further divided into 42 districts. The districts were headed by the governors appointed by the Pharaoh. They were responsible for digging of canals, collection of taxes and administration of justice. He established strong military to maintain internal security, peace and order as well as security on her borders. The king established complex military system comprising the infantry, navy and the charioteers units. The infantry was made up of Egyptian who had chosen the military as career and other mercenaries from Nubia and elsewhere. The charioteers were composed of a more privileged group. Also the country’s ships and sailors were deployed as navy in times of war.",

definition:  "Salt production was one of the indigenous activities especially among the coastal dwellers which helped the economy of the early Ghanaians. The impacts of salt on Ghana’s economy include the following: Salt in Ghana was used for preparation of food. Salt was a very important commodity which was needed in most diets in Ghana. The salt, when put in food added special taste to the food which makes it good for consumption. It was used to prepare variety of local dishes including soup, stew, porridge and others. Salt in the diets of Ghanaians was essential for the upkeep of human bodies and good health. Salt was also used for preservation of fish, meat and other items. Salt was used by the pre-colonial Ghanaian fishermen and livestock farmers to preserve their fishes and meats. During bumper harvest most fishermen used the salt produced in their area to preserve their surplus catch from getting spoiled. This was done by drying the fish in the sun and afterwards applying the salt to it. The practice enabled the coastal states to send fish to the interior states for other agricultural goods. Production of salt also helped to boost production in the leather industries. They used the salt to preserve the leather which was used for production. It provides employment for the Ghanaian people. Salt making in Ghana remained an important occupation for many traditional Ghanaians. Indeed, hundreds of people along the coast, especially the Fante and Adangbe were into the production of salt to earn a living. Salt was demanded for in many ways and through this it forced many people along the coastal region to take part in the extraction of salt for money to provide some basic needs for them. Salt produced at the coast were exchanged for agricultural goods from the forest dwellers during the pre-colonial period. Another importance of salt was that it was used for medicinal purposes. Salt has antiseptic or germ killing properties that made it useful as mouthwash. It was also used for cleaning teeth. Salt was also used by the pre-colonial Ghanaians for curing variety of diseases including stomach upset and certain skin diseases. This was done by mixing it with certain herbs. It was also used for blood clothing when one sustains a deep cut. Salt production in pre-colonial Ghana brought income to the people. Income or wealth was derived from the sale of local salt from the Daboya mines and the sea and lagoon salt from the coast. The income derived from the work was used for their upkeep and development of their villages. Thus, people in the salt business enjoyed a better living standard in their communities out of the monies made from the work.",

question:  "5. Highlight any five roles played by Bishop Ajayi Crowther in the spread of Christianity in Nigeria. [15 marks]",
definition:  "Before the introduction of western medicine by Europeans into Ghana, the Ghanaian people relied on traditional medicine to ensure good health for everyone. The features of the traditional kind of medical practices are given bellow; The Ghanaian people made use of herbal medicine for treatment illnesses and diseases. Before the introduction of western medicine by Europeans into Ghana, medicine men used different herbs to treat various diseases and illnesses that afflicted the people. Common diseases were malaria, chicken pox, small pox, yaws, headache, and many more. Some medicinal plants for treatment include jatropha and leaves of cassava for stopping the flow of blood (blood clotting). Isolation of patients from the community was also a method used in treating certain diseases in pre-colonial Ghana. Diseases like smallpox and leprosy which were considered to be contagious were usually treated at the outskirts of the town or village. Herbal concoction and ointments are prepared for drinking and application to the affected part of the skin. Charms and sorceries were also used in curing diseases that requires spiritual healing. Certain diseases were believed to be spiritual kinds of diseases and therefore demand spiritual interventions before it can be cured. Such diseases include persistent convulsion, epilepsy etc. These diseases were cured by contacting oracles to perform some rituals to determine the cause of the diseases. The oracle after curing the disease usually gives amulets and other charms to the affected person to protect him. Healing by proxy was used by Ghanaian herbalists to cure people with broken bone. Herbs and charms were used in fixing broken bones. It is believed that when a person’s leg was broken they also break that of a hen and applies the same medicine used on the human leg to that of the hen. It is assumed that on the eight day when the broken leg of the hen is healed it means that the human leg would also be healed. The Ghanaian people made use of traditional birth attendants. In the traditional Ghanaian society there were elderly people, especially women who were in charge of delivering babies. These midwives who learnt their trade from the older generation were also qualified herbalists. As qualified herbalists, they played the role of providing medical care not only to the pregnant women in the community but to the people in general especially the infants. Herbal medicine in the form of concoction, juices and ointments were prepared by these traditional birth attendants to cure different kinds of diseases such as headache, stomachache, skin diseases etc. The traditional Ghanaian made use of medicine men called herbalists. These men acquired their knowledge from their elders. Fathers usually taught their sons the uses of certain herbs and roots to treat certain kinds of diseases. For this reason some households became specialists in treating certain kinds of diseases. Herbalists in Ghana treated all kinds of diseases with leaves, roots and bark of trees. Juices of certain plants were used as snuff in cases of severe headache while other juices were applied to cuts and bruises to stop bleeding. For example, the inner bark of the “wawa” tree scrapped fine and mixed with pepper and soaked in water was drunk to cure stomach pains. Soap was also used for curing certain skin diseases by the pre-colonial Ghanaians.",

definition:  "i.Asante \nii. Akyem \niii.Akuapem \niv. Fante \nv. Assin \nvi. Bono \nThe Akan who constitutes about 50% of Ghana’s population live in the forests and free savannah lands of Ghana, the features of the Akan people include the following; Firstly, the Akan spoke Twi and Fante as their language with some variation. The name Akan is a parent language spoken in southern part of Ghana. It is generally applied to some number of languages spoken in Ghana. Among the Akan languages were Twi, Fante, Nzima, Sehwi, Bono and Ahanta. However, Twi and Fante which are closely related in terms of vocabulary dominated the Akan languages spoken in Ghana. The Akan society was generally matrilineal. The people inherited properties and office through the maternal lineage. Sisters inherited from sisters, nephews from uncles, and daughters from mothers. Also, in the Akan family system kings did not inherit the thrones from their fathers but rather from the maternal uncle. In the Akan society, each clan is identified by a symbol or totem. The Akan group has their own totem. They were animals which were sacred for the Akan. Examples of such animals were parrot, snake, dog etc. These animals were protected by taboos hence they were not killed and when a person kills it something bad will happen to the person. It was also. taboo for members of a clan to eat such animals. Members of clan saw themselves as brothers and sisters and thus forbidden to marry. If marriage is contracted unknowingly between members of the same clan, it is considered as taboo and therefore it is dissolved after performing some rituals. Such marriages were considered as abomination and refusal to dissolve that will have bad consequences upon the entire family. The Akan people were polytheistic. The worship of many smaller gods was an important feature of the Akan. Shrines were built for these deities and sacrifices and offerings were made to them very often. The Akan also believed in the Supreme Being known among the twi speaking Akan as “Onyankopon”. They believed that the Supreme Being was the creator of all things and thus the source of life. Again, the ancestors were also worshipped as the people prayed to them for guidance and prosperity. Politically, the Akan people were ruled by kings. The Akan states practised a centralized monarchical system of government. All the powers in the Akan kingdoms or states were vested in the king. The king controls the army and used them for expanding their territories by embarking on wars of conquest on weaker states. The king also performed judiciary function by trying cases and settling dispute among the people. The king tried cases with his council of elders but he pronounced the final ruling or judgment.",

question:  "7. Identify any five socio-economic problems Nigeria faced between 1985 and 1998. [15 marks]",
definition:  "In spite of the remarkable achievements after independence, the country was also confronted with some socio-economic challenges between 197 and 1991. In the place, there was poor infrastructural development in the country. Some parts of the country were lacking roads which made it difficult for people to travel from one place to another. Other infrastructural projects such as hospitals and clinics were also lacking in many parts of the country which led to poor health delivery in the country. Portable water supply was also a major challenge in Ghana during the period. There was inadequate provision of pipe borne water and bore holes in both the cities and villages across the country. Also, the country was faced with unemployment challenges. Many potentially useful individuals were unable to find jobs to earn a living. The absence of jobs led to a rise in social vices as the unemployed youth resulted to desperate means such as stealing, prostitution etc. to make money for a living. These youth were mostly the rural population who migrate to the urban centres with the hope securing a job for themselves. Inadequate power supply was also major socio-economic challenge in Ghana. Many parts of the country were not connected on to the national grid. The situation affected the provision of other social services such as education, health care, water supply and others. Thus, the lack of water supply in some areas in Ghana caused social and economic underdevelopment in many parts of the country. In addition, there was widespread of bribery and corruption in Ghana. The period between 1957 and 1991 witnessed massive bribery and corrupt practices especially by the people in government. Ghanaians kicked against the various political regimes because of the corrupt practices of government officials from the CPP to the PNDC. Many people in government acquired wealth through embezzlement of state funds. They lived in luxury at the expense of the ordinary people. An example of such official was Krobo Adusei, a Cabinet minister of Dr. Nkrumah’s government who imported a golden bed from London for his wife. Furthermore, there were inadequate educational facilities in Ghana. The country faced the problem of inadequate educational facilities in Ghana ranging from elementary to tertiary education. Many school-going young people could not have access to education due to lack of schools in their communities. Also, there were inadequate educational materials to facilitate teaching and learning in the various schools. The country also faced the problem of inadequate human resource in the educational sector.",

question:  "8. Outline any five methods used by the nationalists to achieve independence for Nigeria. [15 marks]",
definition:  "The independence of Ghana in 1957 vas preceded by series of nationalist activities which eventually paved the way for it. The nationalists employed the following methods to achieve independence for Ghana; The formation of political parties promoted independence in Ghana. The formation of political parties was one of the methods employed by nationalists to gain independence for Ghana. The first political party to be formed was the United Gold Coast Convention on the 4th of August 1947 followed by the Convention People Party on 12thJune 1949. These political parties fought hard for the independence of Ghana. Dr. Nkrumah, the political leader of the CPP whose motto was “self-government now” with his charisma and leadership skills was supported by the masses and was very determined to see his beloved country free and independence. The nationalists made use of strikes and demonstrations to achieve independence. The use of demonstrations and strikes was another means used by the nationalists in achieving independence for Ghana. They started demonstrations publicly and also went on strikes to send the message to the colonial government of their intentions for self-rule. Some of these demonstrations took the form violence and caught the attention of the British crown until it finally let go of the colony. Examples of such demonstrations and strike actions were the 1948 riots and boycott. Others include the declaration of the “Positive Action” by Dr. Nkrumah which greatly aroused national consciousness for independence. The formation of the Trade Union Congress promoted independence in Ghana. The union promoted Ghana’s independence by mobilizing workers such as teachers, nurses, ex-servicemen, market women etc. to agitate for the country’s independence. This was done through the use of demonstrations, protests, seminars and other means. The use of newspapers also promoted Ghana’s independence: Ghanaians set up newspapers like the Morning Post, Evening News, Ashanti Pioneer etc. to openly criticize the policies of the colonial administration. These newspapers which were widely patronized made the people aware of the evils of colonialism and the need to attain self-government. The organization of rallies and political enlightenment programmes promoted independence in Ghana. Through the political parties, the nationalists organized rallies which they used to educate the masses about their rights and the exploitations of colonialism. From the rallies, they gained the support of the people which aided in the struggle for independence for the country. Sending of petitions or delegations to the colonial government promoted the independence of Ghana. Between 1900 and 1945, the nationalist movements in Ghana mostly made use of delegations for peaceful negotiations between the people and the colonial government. For instance, the Aborigine’s Right Protection Society caused the abrogation of the 1897 Land Bill by sending delegation to London to present a petition to the British government.",

question:  "9. Identify any five problems of the Organization of African Unity/African Union (OAU/AU). [15 marks]",
definition:  "The organization of African unity was an organization in Africa which comprises of sovereign African states. The organization faced a lot of challenges including the following; One of the problems of OAU was political instability in many member states. Due to the regular coup d’états and unrests in many parts of Africa, member states were not active in supporting the activities of the organization. The constant coups affected the operations of the OAU since some OAU chairmen were removed from office as heads of their respective countries while serving as OAU chairmen. Examples are Dr. Nkrumah of Ghana, president Tolbert of Liberia and the father of OAU, Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia were all chairmen of the organization when they were overthrown. As a result, African leaders were not able to attend summits or conferences for fear of being overthrown in their absence. Another problem faced by the OAU was Language barrier. There are different languages spoken in Africa which have hindered easy interaction among member states of the O.A.U. The continent has four main spoken languages namely English, French, Portuguese and Arabic. This linguistic difference made it difficult for movement from one country to another and also affected consensus building during meetings. Failure of some member countries to attend meetings regularly is also problem of the organization. Many Heads of States do not attend meetings because of pressing internal problems as well as external influence. This attitude of some member states to a large extent hindered the smooth operations of the organization with regards to decision making. Again, the organization has no high Military Command to enforce its decisions. Thus, decisions are only taken on paper and by verbal pronouncements. The organization had no permanent standing army to provide military assistance to conflict prone member states. However, high powered delegations were usually sent to conflict zones for peaceful resolutions. They also faced the problem of finance. Another important problem of the O.A.U. was finance. Some member states were very poor and could not pay their dues regularly. As a result, the organization lacked the funds that will enable it function effectively. Due to the inadequate funds the leadership is unable to run the affairs of the organization smoothly. Border disputes among member states have led to split. This discourages unity among member states. Examples of such disputes are the wars between Ethiopia and Somalia in the Ogaden desert and the Togo and Benin dispute leading to closure of borders. Another border dispute was the conflict between Nigeria and Cameroun over the Bakasssi Peninsula.",
