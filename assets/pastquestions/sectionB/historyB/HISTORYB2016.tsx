question:  "1b. Outline any two ways in which ethnomusicology is important in the study of African history. (6 marks)",
definition:  "Ethnomusicology is the study of the changes that take place in the musical forms of people. The importance of ethnomusicology for the study of African history includes the following; To begin with, ethnomusicology throws light on the origin of some ethnic groups. The text in traditional songs of many ethnic groups at special occasions like festivals gives account of their origin. For example, the traditional account about the origin of the Mole Dagbani states which was carefully preserved by state drummers and recited annually during the Damba festival confirms their migration from the east of the Lake Chad area. Also, the Gawu music and dance of the Ewe of southern Ghana tells the stories of the Ewe migration from the Oyo land in western Nigeria, which was a major Yoruba kingdom. Also, it helps one to know the musical instruments used in the past. For example, people get to know different types of musical instruments such as xylophone, talking drums, gong gong etc. and their functions. E.g., Fontomfrom is used to herald the arrival of chiefs to a durbar ground. Again, it tells the mood of people at a particular period. In the African traditional community, the kind of song which is sung at a given moment depicts or tells the mood of people whether sad or happy. For instance, dirges are played during mourning times while praise songs are played at festive occasions. In addition, it serves as a source of keeping and confirming African past. Since the art of writing was not known to Africans until the arrival of the Arabs and the Europeans, the people kept their history in a form of songs or other forms of music such as drum and horn music. This helps them to confirm important historical events since the lyrics in some African songs are mere playback of the happenings of the past. An example is the special song about Yaa Asantewaa.",

question:  "1c. Give any two reasons for the movement of the primitive man from the savanna to the forest area. (6 marks)",
definition:  "The early man who started life at the savanna region of Africa decided to move to the forest arca for a permanent settlement due to the reasons given below; In the first place, the reduction in rainfall amount at the area caused the movement. Between 1,000,000 BC and 50,000 BC the Savannah had good amount of rainfall which enabled the yield of food crops for man to gather for survival and hunt for games. However, from 50,000 BC onwards, there was a drastic reduction of rainfall in the area. This situation made the savannah region of Africa became drier than before and for that matter the people migrated to the forest region for better life. Water became scarce as well as food supply in this region. As a result, the Stone Age Man who had depended upon fruits, herbs and wild barriers now begun to look elsewhere for more reliable food sources. Also, the improvement in man’s technical knowledge caused the migration to the forest zone. The people made tools suitable for forest environment. Example new heavy chopping tools were made to replace the hand axe and a heavy stone-pick for digging pit-traps and tubers. These newly developed implements or tools gave the Stone Age man the confidence to approach the forest zone. He however, realised that with the introduction of these tools, they would be able to clear and also hunt game. Hence, mar was able to penetrate the bushy and thick forest for farming and permanent settlement. Another reason for the migration of the early man was the discovery of fire. Prior to man’s movement, the Stone Age man could now produce fire by striking rocks together and allowing the sparkles to fall into dried leaves to make fire. Some archaeologists believe that fire was discovered independently by the Early Man in Africa but was not borrowed from Asia as others claim. The debate could be supported with archaeological evidence of discovery of fire at the Kalambo Falls in Zimbabwe. Indeed, the discovery of fire greatly supported the life of early man in the forest zone since it was put into several uses such as making of tools, protection against wild animals, preparation of food, clearing and burning of bush and a source of light.",

question:  "3b. Outline any four features of the political organization of the West African coastal states. (12marks)",
definition:  "The West African coastal states such as Asante, Dahomey, Oyo and many others established a well-structured political administrative system which promoted social and economic development in the various states. The following are the features of the political system of the coastal states; A section of the coastal states made use centralized monarchical system of government. The centralized monarchical system of government was practised by most of the coastal states. Among such states were the Asante, Dahomey, Oyo and Benin. Under this system, political powers rested in a single political authority or in an individual (the king). The kings of these states were regarded as divine and supreme. He was regarded as the intermediary between the gods, ancestors and his subjects. He also performed the political function of being the chief administrator, chief judge and commander of the army. Also, some of the states practised the non-centralized system of government. The non-centralized states had no overall political heads who lead the people. Instead, a council of elders ruled the people. In some cases, it is the traditional priest of the area that wields power and controls the people. Among the non-centralized coastal states were the Guan, Kru and Igbo. In addition, the coastal states had Council of Elders who assisted the kings to rule. Though the kings in the centralized states wielded a lot of power, they were not absolute rulers. They ruled with council of elders made up of sub-chiefs. In Asante, the council was called the Asanteman council, in Benin they were known as the Uzama, and in Oyo they were referred to as the Oyo Mesi. The council played a vital role of assisting the king to make certain important decisions by offering suggestion on issues of grave importance. For instance, in Oyo, the council appointed and promoted officers of the army and had a say in the declaration of war and peace. Furthermore, the states were divided into provinces and districts. Dahomey for example was divided into six provinces. The provincial rulers were responsible for the collection of annual tribute. They also supervised vassal chiefs to ensure that they did not rebel against the king. They also acted as a link between the king and his subjects at the lower level. The states had military organizations. Each of the West African coastal states possessed an army. Each state possessed an army of part-time warriors who were called up in times of need. The Oyo army had both Cavalry and infantry wings whilst the Dahomey and Asante with only the infantry because they operated mainly in the forest environment. The Dahomey had a standing army with a women’s unit known as ‘’Amazon”. Weapons used by the armies of the coastal states were bows and arrows, swords and firearms.",

question:  "4b. Highlight any four factors that contributed to the rise of forest states in Ghana. (12 marks)",
definition:  "The forest zone was the home of most Akan states and kingdoms. These states such as Asante, Denkyira, Akyem and others began as smaller states but later developed into bigger states and kingdoms due to the following reasons; First and foremost, the geographical location of these states contributed to their rise. The location of the forest states was full of natural resources. The area was mixture of forest and thick savannah which made it fertile for agriculture. It was capable of producing abundant food to sustain the population. The land was also full of mineral resources such as gold, diamond, iron etc. which were exploited for the development of the states. The location of their towns which served as major trading centres also promoted trade in the area hence the development of the states. Kumasi was a typical example. Secondly, the possession of able leaders contributed to the rise of the states. The states possessed able leaders who were ambitious to expand their states. The skills and state-craft of those leaders helped to lay the foundation of the states. These rulers expanded their territories through wars of conquest. Examples of such great leaders were Boa Amponsem of Denkyira and Osei Tutu and Opoku Ware of Asante. Also, the acquisition of large quantities of ammunitions from the European traders on the coast caused the rise of the states. Through trading activities the forest states acquired firearms such as gun and gun powder from the coast. The firearms were used to attack less powerful states in the process of extending the boundaries of the powerful states. For instance, Asante’s acquisition of fire arm from the Europeans enabled her to build and effective military to conquer states like Dagomba, Gonja, Akyem, Akwamu etc. Again, Trade also served as a contributing factor towards the rise of the forest states. Their participation in the Atlantic trade brought to the states a lot of wealth leading to their rise. The European goods such as guns, gun powder, building materials and several others helped the growth of the states in the forest region. They also gave out commodities like gold, ivory, slaves and other things for sale to the Europeans. The desire to secure control over areas of economic importance by the states. The desire to control places of economic importance such as gold mines, trading centres and others led to the rise of certain states. The wars of expansion embarked upon by the communities to secure control over important resources resulted in rapid development of states and kingdoms like Akwamu, Denkyira and Asante. These states developed as a result of the scramble to control the gold, ivory, kola nuts and other products of the forest. In addition, unity promoted development among the forest states. Another factor that helped the rise of states in the forest area was unity among the clans and family groups which aided the development of the states. This was so because they traced their descent and origin from a common ancestor. They therefore regarded themselves as one people with a common destiny. Thus, there was little or no rivalry in their efforts to build their states and kingdoms.",

question:  "5. Identify five ways by which the Europeans and Ghanaians profited from trans-Atlantic slave trade (15 marks)",
definition:  "The European presence in Ghana was basically motivated by trading activities which started in the form of legitimate trade but later changed into slave trading. The slave trade increased in volume because of the numerous benefits derived from it by the European and Ghanaian traders. The benefits include the following; To begin with, Ghanaians were Introduced to European manufactured products. The trade brought about importation of several European goods to Ghana. These goods included European cotton cloth, beads, guns and gun powder, alcoholic drinks etc. Ghanaians benefited from these European goods by putting them into good use. For instance, the acquisition of guns and gun powder ensured the protection of many states against attack from enemy states. Also, it was la er used for hunting wild animals by the Ghanaian hunters. Also, the trade caused the rise the rise of states and kingdoms in Ghana. Many interior and coastal states developed as a result of the revenue acquired through taxes from the trade. This helped several states to establish strong political administration system to ensure their growth. Also, the guns and gun powder acquired from the trade were used to embark on successful wars of expansion by these states and kingdoms. Examples of such states are the Asante, Akwamu, Akyem and others. Again, the trade led to the rise of villages and towns in Ghana. The trade led to emergence of urban trading centres such as Elmina, Anornabo, Abonse and many others. These towns and villages developed into bigger and popular market centres due to the trade which served as a magnet that attracted people from all wards of life to settle in such towns and villages. In addition, the trade increased the wealth of Ghanaian chiefs. Ghanaian chiefs established trade routes and collected taxes and tolls to enrich themselves. They collected tolls from traders who apply the route that passes through their territories. Also, traders were made to pay taxes on commodities acquired at the market centres in their states. They also benefited from the trade by selling slaves that were captured through wars of conquest. Furthermore, the trade led to the rise of a class of wealthy indigenous Ghanaian merchants. These men played leading roles in the 17th  and 18th centuries coastal society. Among them were Edward Barter of Cape Coast, John Cabes of Kemenda and John Cudjoe Cabocceer of Cape Coast, founder of the ruling dynasty of Cape Coast. They became wealthy and assumed positions of importance in the coastal society. Though these men contributed in one way or the other to the development of the Gold Coast, the harmful effects of the trade made such contribution worthless. On the part of the Europeans, the trade provided cheap labour for them. They acquired cheap labour force from Ghana or Africa in general for their farms and mines in the New World. This boosted the production of raw materials for their home industries in Europe leading to the growth their economy.",

question:  "6. In what five ways were the Christian missionary activities disadvantageous to the people of Ghana in the 19th century? (15 marks)",
definition:  "The European missionaries began their missionary activities in Ghana in the 15th century with the main objective of converting people to Christianity. However, in spite of the good works of the missionaries, there were some negative impacts of missionary activities upon the people. These include the following: To start with, the missionaries discouraged the practice of traditional religion. To help easy spread of Christianity in Ghana, the European Missionaries condemned the traditional religious practices of the people. Traditional practices of offering sacrifices and pouring libation to the gods and ancestors for their blessing, protection etc. were heavily condemned as backward and dark-aged culture. As a result, many Ghanaians abandoned their once cherished traditional religion for Christianity. Also, they replaced traditional names with Christian names. The Ghanaian culture was completely looked down upon to the extent that the people changed their traditional names for European kind of names. This started with the introduction of formal education when Ghanaian pupils who enrolled into the missionary schools were baptized and given European Christian names such as John, Peter, Paul, George etc. as their first names. In this case, an African name no matter its meaning could not be a Christian or first name at school. Again, the missionaries provided narrow education to the Ghanaian people. Since the British indirect rule system had no great need for educated Ghanaians, the Missionaries were much more concerned about bringing up a kind of educated Ghanaian who would reject all kinds of Ghanaian traditional practices and customs and promote Bible knowledge, arithmetic, reading and writing. For that matter, Ghanaians were given education basically on reading and writing. More so, they introduced irrelevant curriculum to the country. The curriculum given to schools was designed to suit the basic needs of the missionaries, trading firms and colonial administration as against the basic needs of the Ghanaian people. In addition, they condemned the Ghanaian way of dressing and the local language. Ghanaian mode of dressing was gradually changed for the European style through the school and job systems. School children were made to wear shirts tacked inside a pair of shorts as school uniform but under goes modification as they progressed on the academic ladder. Also, European style of dressing was adopted for European jobs and positions. An example was the wearing of suit for office work. More so, they also discouraged the development of any Ghanaian language into a national language but rather the English language. The English language became the official language and the major means of communication among the various ethnic groups that made up the population of Ghana. Furthermore, the Christian missionary activities created division within families. The Missionary activities created a sort of division among family members when converts were separated from the general community for a special settlement established by the European Missionaries for the Ghanaian converts. This practice known as the Salem system was adopted by the Basel Mission to prevent their Christian converts from observing certain traditional customs in their local communities. The missionaries also condemned Ghanaian marriage system and other rites and customs. The Ghanaian polygamous system of marriage was condemned by the Missionaries for the European monogamous system. The Ghanaian Christian converts however abandoned the long-standing polygamous system and the traditional procedures of contracting marriage for the European monogamy and the Christian church marriage. libation to the gods and ancestors for their blessing, protection etc. were heavily condemned as backward and dark-aged culture.

question:  "7. Highlight any five roles played by traditional rulers during the colonial rule in Ghana. (15marks)",
definition:  "The British administrative system under the indirect rule gave much recognition to the Ghanaian traditional rulers who played diverse role in the colonial administrative system in Ghana. The following are the role of the chiefs during the colonial rule; The chiefs served as link between the people and the colonial government. The traditional chiefs acted as the link between the local people and the British Colonial Government officials. He normally conveys the grievances of the local people to the colonial government officials and relays the policies of the colonial government to the local people. The chiefs were given the power to approve or disapprove decisions made by the governor since they represent the people. Also, they served as members of the Legislative Council. The traditional chiefs served as members of the legislative council under the system of Indirect Rule. The British colonial government gave chiefs more representation on the legislative councils in the various colonies than the educated elites. As members of the legislative councils, chiefs contributed to the passing of laws known as colonial ordinance. Later, some chiefs also served on the Executive Councils where they took part in the formulation of policies. Again, the chiefs were made rulers of traditional communities. With the enactment of the Native Jurisdiction Ordinance in 1924, the British legally recognized the institution of chieftaincy and used the chiefs as an integral part of colonial system of administration. The chiefs were giving the power to perform such functions as maintenance of law and order and making by-laws. The by-laws were used to regulate the behaviours of the local people to ensure maximum control of the chiefs over their communities. They performed such political functions under the supervision of the British Resident Official such as the Provincial and District Commissioners In addition, the traditional rulers formed the Native Court (settling of disputes). The chiefs served as arbitrators of matters that affected their communities at local levels. Under the Native Administration ordinance of 1827, chiefs and their councils were given the powers to settle all matters within the states. They presided over the court and tried cases applying customary laws. Various forms of punishments including fines and detention were given out to offenders. Indeed, the chiefs promoted peace among the people in their communities. Furthermore, the traditional rulers were made in charge of tax collection. Under the Indirect Rule, traditional rulers were empowered to establish native treasuries. The chiefs were allowed to levy taxes on their subject based on the approval of the District Commissioners, to be paid into the Native Treasuries. Other taxes from licensing, market tolls, fines from the local courts etc. were paid into the Native Treasury. Part of such revenue was sent to the coffers of the central government whiles the remainder is kept under the control of the traditional rulers. They Mobilized and supervised developmental programmes. The chiefs were often at the forefront in any community development programmes. They saw to the improvement of roads, sanitation, markets and many more by organising and supervising communal labour for such developmental projects. Per the Ghanaian traditional customs, people obey the orders of their chiefs by participating in such programmes whenever they are organised to ensure the development of their villages.",

question:  "8b. Outline any four demands of the National Congress of British West Africa (NCBWA) (12 marks)",
definition:  "The National Congress of British West Africa (NCBWA) was the first major nationalist movement established against the colonial regime in Ghana. The movement was founded in 1919 by J. E. Casely Hayford. Among the demands of the NCBWA were the following; Firstly, the congress demanded for separation of the judicial service from the political administration. They saw the need for the judiciary to be free from the other organs of gov’t so as to enable them to administer justice without fear or favour. By this, the judicial service will perform their functions separately from the administration to enable them function properly. Secondly, they wanted Africans to control the selection and dismissal of traditional rulers. This was to end the British interference in the political affairs of the local people. The group however saw the need to preserve customs and traditions of the land especially under the chieftaincy institution. Thus, Africans must be allowed to select and dismiss their own chiefs based on their customs and usage. Also, they asked the British guarantee the right of Africans to own and control their lands. By this, the group meant that African lands must be own and control by the African chiefs and the people instead of the colonial governor. This demand was in line with the customs and traditions of the people of Africa that lands are owned by the people through their ancestors who occupied them. Again, the congress demanded for the establishment of a university for the four colonies. This was to preserve African nationality and raise the standard of education of the people. It was also to create the opportunity for higher education for the African population to appreciate the social, economic and political situation at the time. However, it is believed that in response to this demand, the University of Ibadan and Gold Coast were established in Nigeria and Ghana respectively in 1948, long after the collapse of the NCBWA in 1930. Furthermore, they demand for establishment of African Court of Appeal. The NCBWA forsaw that there was the need for a court which was higher and supreme and which could trial cases that were considered complicated. The West African court of appeal was to investigate and deal with cases between British West African countries. The elite were dissatisfied with the existing judicial system with no single appeals court in the entire British West African colonies. They however, wanted to end the situation at the time where one can only make an appeal only through the Privy Council in London. They also wanted the discrimination against Africans to stop. Discrimination with regard to appointment and advancement in the public services must stop. There should be equal opportunities for both qualified West Africans and their European counterparts. Africans were discriminated against in all aspects of the economy especially in the civil service. Better positions in the civil services were given to the British personnel while the Africans with equal or even better qualifications were left out.",
