// I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. It has been quite some time since you left for your course abroad, and we all miss you dearly. While we understand the importance of your work, we can’t help but feel your absence in our daily lives. I thought I’d take a moment to update you on how the family has been faring since you left.  
// Mom has been doing a fantastic job keeping everything in order. She’s juggling work, household chores, and making sure we stick to our routines. Though she never says it, I know she misses you a lot. She often talks about how proud she is of you and keeps reminding us of how important it is to support each other until you return.  
// [Sibling’s Name], as usual, has been their lively self. They’ve taken up a new hobby—[mention hobby, e.g., painting, soccer]—and have been excelling at it. They can’t wait to show you their progress when you come back. As for me, school has been busy but manageable. I’ve been trying my best to help Mom whenever I can, and I’ve even started [mention a personal achievement or activity].  
// The house feels a little quieter without you around, especially during family meals. We all miss your jokes and the way you light up the room. Even [mention a family pet, if applicable, e.g., “Max, our dog”] seems to notice you’re not here and looks at the door expectantly sometimes.  
// We’re counting down the days until you return. In the meantime, we’re holding onto the thought that you’re making the most of your time abroad and learning so much that will benefit you and us.  
// Please take care of yourself, Dad. We’re all eagerly waiting to hear from you and to have you back with us soon. Until then, know that we’re all fine and doing our best to make you proud.

question: "2. Write an article for publication in a cultural magazine on the advantages and disadvantages of the extended family system.",
definition: [
// The Extended Family System: A Double-Edged Sword  
// The extended family system, where multiple generations and relatives live together or maintain close-knit relationships, has been a defining feature of many cultures worldwide. While it fosters unity and mutual support, it also comes with challenges that cannot be overlooked. Let us explore the advantages and disadvantages of this age-old familial structure.  
// Advantages of the Extended Family System  
// 1. Emotional and Financial Support  
// One of the most significant advantages of the extended family system is the emotional and financial support it offers. Members can rely on each other during difficult times, whether it is sharing the burden of expenses, providing childcare, or offering a shoulder to lean on. This collective strength helps families weather crises more effectively.  
// 2. Cultural Preservation  
// The extended family system plays a vital role in preserving traditions, values, and cultural practices. Elders often serve as custodians of cultural heritage, passing down stories, customs, and life lessons to younger generations, ensuring that cultural identity remains intact.  
// 3. Shared Responsibilities  
// Living in an extended family means sharing household responsibilities. From cooking and cleaning to caring for children and the elderly, tasks are distributed among members, reducing the workload on any one individual. This shared approach fosters teamwork and mutual respect.  
// 4. Stronger Social Bonds  
// Extended families promote a sense of belonging and unity. Celebrating milestones, festivals, and other events together strengthens interpersonal relationships and creates a network of support that can be comforting and uplifting.  
// Disadvantages of the Extended Family System  
// 1. Invasion of Privacy  
// One of the most common drawbacks of the extended family system is the lack of personal space and privacy. With many members living together, it can be challenging to establish boundaries, leading to conflicts and misunderstandings.  
// 2. Conflicting Opinions  
// Different generations often have differing viewpoints on various issues, from parenting styles to career choices. These generational gaps can lead to disagreements and friction, which may strain relationships within the family.  
// 3. Financial Strain  
// While financial support is an advantage, it can also become a source of tension. When one member earns significantly more than others or is expected to shoulder most of the family’s expenses, it can create resentment and feelings of inequality.  
// 4. Dependence and Lack of Independence  
// The extended family system sometimes fosters excessive dependence among members. Younger individuals may struggle to develop independence and decision-making skills, as they are often influenced or overshadowed by older relatives.  
// Conclusion  
// The extended family system is a powerful social unit that offers numerous benefits, including support, cultural preservation, and shared responsibilities. However, it also presents challenges such as privacy issues, generational conflicts, and financial strain. Striking a balance between maintaining close family ties and respecting individual autonomy is essential to making the extended family system work in today’s evolving world.  By embracing the strengths of this system while addressing its drawbacks, families can create an environment that is both nurturing and harmonious.

question: "3. The last nation-wide strike by secondary school teachers affected your school adversely. Write a letter to the Minister of Education suggesting at least three ways of preventing future strike actions.",
definition: [
// [Your Address]  
// [City, State, ZIP Code]  
// [Date]  
// The Honorable [Minister's Full Name]  
// Minister of Education  
// [Ministry's Address]  
// [City, State, ZIP Code]  
// Dear Sir/Madam,  
// Subject: Suggestions to Prevent Future Strike Actions in Secondary Schools
// I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to you as a concerned student of [Your School's Name], following the recent nation-wide strike by secondary school teachers that disrupted our academic activities. The strike caused significant disruptions in our learning, and I would like to offer some suggestions that could potentially prevent such actions in the future.  
// 1. Improved Communication and Dialogue  
// One of the key factors that contributed to the strike was the lack of effective communication between the government and teaching staff. Establishing a regular platform for open dialogue, where teachers can express their concerns and suggestions directly to the Ministry, would go a long way in addressing grievances before they escalate. I suggest creating a formal committee that includes representatives from the Ministry, teachers, and school administration to regularly review issues related to the education sector.  
// 2. Timely Payment and Incentives for Teachers  
// The strike was partly driven by issues related to teachers’ salaries and incentives. I recommend that the Ministry prioritize the timely payment of salaries and consider introducing more attractive benefits and incentives for teachers. Ensuring that teachers are fairly compensated for their hard work will not only improve their morale but also reduce the likelihood of industrial actions.  
// 3. Continuous Professional Development and Support  
// Another contributing factor to the strike was the feeling among teachers that their professional growth and development were not adequately supported. The Ministry could invest in continuous professional development programs that provide teachers with the necessary training, resources, and support to improve their teaching methods. This would help teachers feel valued and motivated to continue their work without resorting to strikes.  
// Conclusion  
// I believe that with open communication, fair compensation, and continuous support for teachers, we can prevent future strikes that disrupt the academic environment. Teachers play a pivotal role in shaping the future of the nation, and it is essential that their concerns are addressed promptly and effectively.  
// Thank you for considering these suggestions. I trust that with your leadership, we can work towards a more stable and productive educational system for all students and teachers alike.  
// Yours sincerely,  
// [Your Full Name]  
// [Your Grade/Class]

question: "4. You are a speaker in a debate on the topic “Civilian rule is better than military rule.” Write your  contribution for or against the motion.",
definition: [
   // Speech: “Civilian Rule is Better Than Military Rule”
   // Honorable judges, esteemed members of the opposition, and my fellow debaters,
   // I stand before you today to argue for the motion: “Civilian rule is better than military rule.” While both forms of governance may appear similar in some respects, the differences in their long-term effects on society are profound. Civilian rule, in which elected leaders govern with the consent of the people, is a system that promotes stability, growth, and fundamental human rights.
   // 1. Protection of Democratic Rights and Freedoms
   // At the heart of civilian rule is the preservation of democracy. Civilian governments are typically elected through free and fair elections, ensuring that the voices of the people are heard and respected. This accountability encourages leaders to be responsive to the needs of their citizens. In contrast, military rule often leads to authoritarian regimes that curtail civil liberties, suppress political opposition, and limit free speech. Under military rule, fundamental rights such as freedom of expression, assembly, and the press are often restricted, making it difficult for citizens to voice concerns or challenge governmental policies.
   // 2. Promotion of Long-Term Development
   // Civilian governments tend to prioritize policies that foster long-term development and stability. Elected officials, aware that their tenure is tied to public approval, often focus on creating policies that improve education, healthcare, infrastructure, and the economy. Military rule, on the other hand, tends to focus on short-term stability and the consolidation of power. Military governments often lack the expertise in running complex economies and social systems, leading to inefficiency and stagnation. This can result in economic hardship, social inequality, and long-lasting damage to the country’s development.
   // 3. Respect for Rule of Law and Governance Structures
   // Civilian governments operate within a framework of laws, including a constitution that outlines the rights and responsibilities of citizens and the state. The judiciary is independent, ensuring that the rule of law is upheld and that justice is served without bias. Military rule, by nature, often operates outside the rule of law, with the military leaders assuming unchecked power. This can result in arbitrary decisions, unfair trials, and a lack of legal recourse for citizens who are wronged. Without an independent judiciary, human rights abuses and corruption become rampant.
   // 4. Social Cohesion and National Unity
   // Civilian governments, elected by the people, generally reflect the diversity and interests of the population. Civilian rule allows for the peaceful coexistence of different political, ethnic, and social groups. It offers a platform for dialogue and compromise. In contrast, military rule tends to favor a singular ideology or group, often leading to divisions within society. When the military seizes power, it can create an environment of fear, mistrust, and division, as dissent is often silenced with force.
   // 5. International Relations and Global Perception
   // Under civilian rule, nations are more likely to establish diplomatic and economic relations with other countries. Civilian governments are viewed as legitimate by international organizations like the United Nations and can engage in beneficial agreements, trade, and cooperation. Military governments, however, often face international isolation, as other nations may view them as illegitimate or oppressive. This can lead to sanctions, reduced foreign investment, and a lack of global cooperation, which further harms the country's growth and stability.
   // Conclusion
   // In conclusion, civilian rule promotes democracy, long-term development, respect for the rule of law, social cohesion, and positive international relations. While military rule may sometimes seem like a quick solution in times of crisis, its long-term effects are often detrimental to both the nation and its people. Civilian governments, built on the principles of accountability and the rule of law, provide the foundation for a stable and prosperous future.
   // Therefore, I firmly believe that civilian rule is better than military rule, and I urge you all to support the motion.
   // Thank you.,

question: "5. Write a story, real or imagined, which illustrates the saying: “Make hay while the sun shines.”",
definition: [
// Make Hay While the Sun Shines
// In the small village of Willowbrook, nestled among rolling hills, lived an ambitious farmer named Thomas. He was well-known for his hard work and his devotion to his crops. He had a modest piece of land, but every year, his harvest was bountiful. His neighbors often admired how he seemed to always have everything in perfect order, even when the seasons were unpredictable.
// One year, the weather turned odd. The spring rains came late, and by the time summer arrived, there were only a few weeks of dry weather left to harvest the hay. Many of Thomas’s neighbors, seeing the clouds gathering on the horizon, thought the rain would come again soon. They decided to wait a few days before cutting their hay, hoping the weather would stay clear long enough for the crop to fully ripen.
// Thomas, however, had always believed in making the most of every opportunity. He woke up at dawn every day, well before the sun peeked over the hills. He worked tirelessly, cutting, drying, and stacking the hay in the warm sunlight. He knew that the forecast was uncertain, and the next rainstorm could ruin everything. The farmers around him laughed and called him too eager, but Thomas remained focused.
// As the days passed, the rain clouds gathered more and more. By the time the other farmers finally decided to begin harvesting, the weather turned, and heavy showers flooded the fields. The hay they left out to dry became soggy, molding before they could gather it in. Many of them lost a good portion of their crops.
// But Thomas’s hay, dried and stacked just in time, was safe. When the storm finally passed, his barn was full, and he had enough to feed his livestock through the winter and sell to the neighboring towns. His foresight and hard work paid off, while the others were left scrambling, realizing too late that they had missed their opportunity.
// Thomas’s success that year became a lesson for the entire village. They all learned the wisdom of making hay while the sun shines—taking advantage of good conditions and not waiting for things to be "perfect" or guaranteed. When opportunities arise, it’s important to act quickly and decisively.
// Indeed, Thomas’s story would be remembered for years as the living proof of the old saying: “Make hay while the sun shines.”

instruction: "6. Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions on it.",
passage: "Bitrus, a middle-aged man, was speeding along the hot tarmac one afternoon, oblivious of the countryside.  By his side, reading a magazine was his first son, a twenty-year old university computer science student. On  the man’s mind was the contract he was pursuing in the capital city. It was worth several million dollars.  Although he had handled bigger contracts before, Bitrus was preoccupied with this new challenge, his mind  far away from the road before him.  His son was also buried in the magazine he was reading. So neither saw the goat crossing the road early  enough. Like automation, Bitrus jammed on the brakes. In a flash, there was a skid and a somersault. The  villagers worked for almost an hour on the huge Mercedes before rescuing the two.  There, in the casualty ward, the duo lay on the stretchers. Bitrus was soon in a fairly stable, but anybody  would know that the son needed prompt specialist medical attention. The doctor was sent for, a surgeon  who regularly handled such cases. Soon enough, the doctor came. The nurses heaved a sigh of relief. But  then... “Oh no, I can’t handle this case. He’s my son!” Everyone was shocked. One of the nurses pleaded. “But  doctor, you must do something otherwise,... “No, he’s my son. I’ll have to transfer this case.” And so tearfully,  more agitated than anybody around, the doctor hurried away to call a colleague.  Here was Bitrus, with multiple injuries, but not in danger. In the adjoining room was his son, still comatose.  How then could a doctor come in and say, “This is my son”? Wasn’t Bitrus the father after all? Most people  would reason that the doctor was truly the secret biological father. Others, reasoning hard, would conclude  that the doctor was Bitrus’s father and thus was right in describing him as his son. But for how long would  people continue to think that all doctors must be male? Couldn’t the doctor have simply been Mrs. Bitrus?",

instruction: "7. Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions on it.",
passage: "In the 1960s and 1970s undergraduates did not need to apply for employment. Employees usually wooed  them by depositing offers of jobs in their halls of residence for those interested to pick and choose from as  soon as they finished writing their degree examinations. How things have changed! We have since  “progressed” from this age of abundance in which unemployment was hardly heard of to one of  economic recession and widespread unemployment. The problem is so acute that one finds unemployment  even among engineers and doctors.  What are the causes of this phenomenon? For one thing, our educational system does not train its products  for self-employment. Everybody expects the government or the private sector to provide them with a job at  the end of their studies. As we have now realized, the government and the private sector combined cannot  create enough jobs to go round the army of graduates turned out annually by our universities. For another,  many parents encourage their children to enroll in courses leading to prestigious  and lucrative professions for which they may be intellectually unsuited. They end up obtaining poor degrees  or none at all. Such graduates cannot compete on the job market, so they swell the ranks of the  unemployable and the unemployed.  Perhaps the most important single cause of unemployment is economic recession. During periods of boom,  economic activities are generated in abundance and these make plenty of jobs available. But the reverse is  the case in times of economic recession.  There is no simple solution to the problem. Everyone in the society has a role to play here. The government  has a duty to ensure that the economy is buoyant, thus providing the right environment for the creation of  jobs. The educational authorities have to orientate the process of education towards the production of job  creators rather than job seekers.  Guidance and counseling services should be made available in all secondary institutions. Parents, too,  should stop misdirecting their children into choosing careers for which they are ill-suited.",

passage: "Poverty! Can anyone who has not really been poor know what poverty is? I really doubt it. How can anyone who enjoys three square meals a day explain what poverty means? Indeed can someone who has two full meals a day claim to know poverty? Perhaps, one begins to grasp the full meaning of poverty when one struggles really hard to have one miserable meal in twenty-four hours. Poverty and hunger are cousins, the former always dragging along the latter wherever he chooses to go. If you were wearing a suit, or a complete traditional attire, and you look naturally rotund in your apparel, you cannot understand what poverty entails. Nor can you have a true feel of poverty if you have some good shirts and pairs of trousers, never mind that all these are casual wear. Indeed, if you can change one dress into another, and these are all you can boast of, you are not really poor. A person begins to have a true feel of what poverty means when, apart from the tattered clothes on his body, he doesn’t have any other; not even calico to keep away the cold at night. Let us face it, can anyone who has never slept outside, in the open, appreciate the full, harsh import of homelessness? Yet that is what real, naked poverty is. He who can lay claim to a house, however humble, cannot claim to be poor. Indeed, if he can afford to rent a flat, or a room in town or city, without the landlord having cause to eject him, he cannot honestly claim to be poor. The really poor man has no roof over his head, and this is why you find him under a bridge, in a tent or simply in the vast open air. But that is hardly all. The poor man faces the world as a hopeless underdog. In every bargain, every discussion, every event involving him and others, the poor man is constantly reminded of his failure in life. Nobody listens attentively when he makes a point, nobody accepts that his opinion merits consideration. So in most cases, he learns to accept that he has neither wisdom nor opinion. The pauper’s lot naturally rubs off on his child who is subject not only to hunger of the body but also of the mind. The pauper lacks the resources to send his child to school. And even in communities where education is free, the pauper’s child still faces an uphill task because the hunger of the body impedes the proper nourishment of the mind. Denied access to modern communications media, the poor child has very little opportunity to understand the concepts taught him. His mind is rocky soil on which the teacher’s seeds cannot easily germinate. Thus embattled at home and then at school, the pauper’s child soon has very little option but to drop out of school. That is still not all. Weakened by hunger, embattled by cold and exposure to the elements, feeding on poor water and poor food, the pauper is an easy target for diseases. This is precisely why the poorest countries have the shortest life expectancies while the longest life expectancies are recorded among the richest countries. Poverty is really a disease that shortens life!",
