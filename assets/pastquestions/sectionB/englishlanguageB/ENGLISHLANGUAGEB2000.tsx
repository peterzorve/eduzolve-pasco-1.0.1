"The Unexpected Turn\n",
"It was the day of the much-anticipated annual school debate competition, and Clara had prepared for weeks. She had her arguments polished, her delivery practiced to perfection, and her confidence soaring. However, as fate would have it, the morning brought an unexpected twist. Clara woke up with a severe sore throat, barely able to speak.\n",
"Her mother suggested she stay home and rest, but Clara insisted on attending the event, hoping her voice might recover in time. When she arrived at the venue, her heart sank as she struggled to croak out a single sentence during a quick rehearsal. She realized there was no way she could participate.\n",
"Seeing her distress, Mr. Adams, the debate coordinator, approached her. “Clara, I know how much you’ve prepared for this, but maybe it’s time to support your team in a different way,” he said gently. “Would you be willing to mentor Alex, our alternate speaker? He’s nervous but has great potential.”\n",
"Reluctantly, Clara agreed. She spent the next few hours helping Alex refine his arguments, teaching him techniques to stay calm under pressure, and cheering him on. Despite her disappointment, she poured all her energy into preparing him.\n",
"When the competition began, Clara watched anxiously from the audience. To her surprise, Alex delivered a stunning performance. His voice was steady, his arguments compelling, and his confidence contagious. By the end of the event, their team had secured first place, and Alex was awarded the “Best Speaker” prize.\n",
"Later, Alex approached Clara with tears in his eyes. “I couldn’t have done it without you,” he said. “You believed in me when I didn’t believe in myself.”\n",
"Clara smiled, her earlier disappointment fading away. She realized that, in losing her chance to shine, she had gained something far more meaningful—a new friendship, the joy of seeing someone succeed, and the knowledge that her guidance had made a difference.\n",
"Indeed, it was a blessing in disguise.",

question: "5. You are a speaker in an inter-school debate on the topic: 'It is better to attend a school near your home than one outside your neighbourhood'. Write your speech for or against the proposition.",
definition: [
"Speech: It is Better to Attend a School Near Your Home than One Outside Your Neighbourhood",
"Good morning, respected judges, teachers, and fellow students.",
"I stand here today to speak for the proposition that it is better to attend a school near your home than one outside your neighbourhood.",
"1. Saves Time and Energy",
"First and foremost, attending a school near your home saves valuable time and energy. Long commutes to schools outside your neighbourhood can be exhausting, especially for younger students. The time spent in traffic or on public transportation could instead be used for studying, pursuing hobbies, or spending quality time with family.",
"2. Strengthens Community Bonds",
"A local school fosters a sense of community. Students who attend a neighbourhood school are more likely to interact with their peers outside of school hours, creating deeper and lasting friendships. This sense of belonging strengthens social ties and builds a supportive environment for both students and parents.",
"3. Encourages Active Participation in School Life",
"Proximity makes it easier for students and their families to participate in school activities. Parents can attend parent-teacher meetings, sports events, and cultural programs without the hassle of traveling long distances. This increased involvement enhances the overall educational experience for the student.",
"4. Reduces Costs and Environmental Impact",
"A school near home reduces transportation costs and minimizes environmental impact. Walking or cycling to school not only saves money but also promotes a healthier and more sustainable lifestyle. In contrast, long commutes contribute to air pollution and traffic congestion.",
"Counterarguments and Rebuttals",
"Some may argue that schools outside the neighbourhood offer better facilities or opportunities. However, with advancements in education and government policies, many local schools now provide high-quality education and extracurricular options. Moreover, the stress and fatigue caused by long commutes often outweigh any potential benefits of attending a distant school.",
"Conclusion",
"In conclusion, attending a school near your home offers numerous advantages, including saving time and energy, building community bonds, encouraging active participation, and reducing costs and environmental harm. Education is not just about academics—it is also about holistic growth, and a local school provides the ideal environment for this.",
"Thank you."

passage: "I vividly remember that Thursday morning, some twenty-two years ago, when I was operated upon to have an abnormality corrected. For months, the doctors had combated the ailment with drugs of various kinds, many of which sent me on long excursions into slumber land. Yet the ailment had seemed to defy all medical entreaties. Then a few days later, two senior surgeons called on me to discuss their decision. They made it clear that only a surgical operation held any hope, otherwise the downward trend was sure to continue until the inevitable quiet end. So, they sought my consent which I promptly gave, stating that at my age I was old enough to accept any eventuality. For days, I was gradually prepared for the great event. I took various drugs to build me up physically, and I was encouraged to eat well. eesides, a clergyman came regularly to talk to and pray for me, He assured me that I would sail through the operation safely as God, the greatest of Surgeons, would join the medical team. Gradually I steeled myself to face the exercise. Then the day came. My wife came very early into the ward, looking as if she bore the burdens of all the world. I told her to be a good girl and cheer up. eut all my jokes fell flat. So, when a senior nursing sister came and told my wife to go and buy one of the drugs needed, I was somehow relieved. Moments later, my eldest son came, and I told him to brace up for any eventuality. I said I was proud of his achievements as a young engineer, and of his immediate younger brother as a pharmacist. So, if the end should come, they should both rise to the occasion and steer their other brother and sister to good careers. I had not quite concluded when the stretcher was wheeled in and I was helped on to it. As the journey to the theatre commenced, with my son by my side, I held his hand firmly and smiled. This was the only way I could reassure him that all was going to be well. The stretcher moved on. Then, suddenly, I saw my wife hurrying to catch up with us. As she came along, I told the ward attendants to slow down so that she could catch up with us. I took her hand and put it in my son's. Apparently, this gesture disturbed rather than strengthened her. She burst into tears eefore I could say anything else, to mother and son, the theatre doors were found open; and the stretcher was wheeled in.",
