passage: "Parents are the most important models for growing children; in fact the first influences on them. First, the parents usually are the earliest human contact the child has in the world around him. They are the most enduring models because of their being present longer than other social agents. In the eyes of the child, parents are by far the most powerful people. They influence the child through nurturing him and providing his needs. In a word, his survival almost solely depends on them. Undoubtedly then, the child looks up to these prime models for the development of his character. Perhaps this explains some of the traditional sayings which suggest that the child takes after the parents. Take the expression. 'a chip off the old block', for instance, which is often used to confirm the close similarity between the behaviour of the child and his parents'. It stands to reason that the child naturally picks up his traits, whether good or b1 ad, from his parents. Although the child's parents are his earliest and most important models, he is exposed to many other potent influences: siblings, television, school, celebrities and so on. The walls of boys' rooms, for example, are often covered with the pictures of their idols. They sometimes walk, talk, and to some extent, behave like them. But do children emulate the behaviour of everyone? It is known that they do not imitate all the people they know in equal degrees. It is therefore important to understand the variables that determine the extent to which the child takes up the attributes and behaviour displayed by his models. Studies have shown that this is not a simple case of imitation. One strong determination is identification with the object of admiration. For instance, if a young girl wishes to be like her father, it is because she loves him. Secondly, she believes that she can do both the great and admirable things her father does. On the other hand, the father could have been selected because of his care and generosity in nurturing her.",

passage: "Last Sunday, I happened to be a visitor at one of the big churches in the city, I was outside because I had arrived late, which is a normal occurrence in this part of the world, and there was a big bar across the entrances to the auditorium. While outside, I witnessed an incident which I found moving. One of the members of the congregation who could not sit through the service was a toddler. He was a rather special child about three years old. He was one of those children who have a stormy beginning in life, involving brain surgery, among other things. He was just learning to walk. That day he was having the time of his life, running up and down the large church premises. The church was by a busy main road and every time he headed towards the gates he was in danger of being crushed by a passing vehicle. Running alongside the little boy and keeping pace with him was his father. All this while, the father was never impatient nor did he shout at the boy to sit still. This reminded me of another father I came across many years ago. His baby boy, Francis, was born with cleft lip which caused a large split in his face. The defect could be repaired but not until he was older. The parents were counselled and they took the baby home. But their troubles were just beginning. They lived in a house with several other tenants. The other tenants decided to make life unpleasant for the couple. Their persistent teasing and nasty comments nearly drove them away from the house. The rumour went round that the mother had given birth to a baby with a 'half face'. People would gather round the house just to laugh at the child and his parents. Some would call the mother names as she passed by. Things became so unbearable that something had to be done. 'I decided to put him in my taxi and work with him so that his mother would be spared all that trouble', the father said to me, as he recounted this sad story. The child occupied space in the car, which could have been taken up by a paying passenger. This certainly affected his daily earnings. Many fathers of children with clefts feel too embarrassed to allow them out of the house. Not this man. He would drive round the city with Francis in the front seat. This must have put off many passengers, scared by the face of little Francis. Today, Francis is a healthy eight-year-old. After the repair of the cleft, he has become his father's pride and joy.",

section: "SECTION C SUMMARY",
instruction: "8. Read the following passage carefully and answer, in your own words as far as possible, the questions on it.",
passage: "In the western world, the family is considered generally as comprising the husband, wife and children. In Africa, the idea goes beyond this nuclear family to include relations from both the maternal and paternal lineage. The extended family system is such that it includes everybody related to both of one's parents. The relationship is binding on every member of the family insofar as their origins can be traced to the same ancestors whose blood is believed to run through the members in varying proportions. This, in fact, accounts for the development of such complex groups as clans and kinship relations. The extended family exists as an essential trait of the social structures of most, if not all, African and some Melanesian societies. And wherever it is practised, its benefits are seen to be greater than its disadvantages. In Ghana, at the small community level, the extended family serves to foster unity among the people who relate to one another as one and the same people who always share everything among the elves - be it wealth or problems. The system also allows for fostering closer relationships within and between lineages. Thus people who, it might seem, are separated by social factors such as marriage outside the community still have close relationships. It also enables the family, apart from being a fundamental social unit based on biological factor of procreation - man, wife, children and may be grandchildren - to develop into a complex group as the joint family. This is often a wider group comprising the husband and the wife (or wives) and the spouses of the children as well as the children of these and other relatives. The extended family system contributes significantly to the reduction of conflict between ethnic groups. Through marriage, the family network spreads from one group into another, In the process, groups who might have been antagonistic towards each other in the past develop relationships. This imposes some social restraints on hostile elements in the society. In spite of these, the extended family system has shortcomings. It often makes people look up to others fqr assistance when they could work independently to achieve the object for which they seek assistance. Obviously, it encourages laziness in some people as they know the have someone to whom they can look up to for every bit of help. In the long run, the only well-to-do person within the family becomes overburdened with the problems of more people than he can really cope with.",
