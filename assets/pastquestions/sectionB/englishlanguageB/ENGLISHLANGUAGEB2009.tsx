passage: "6: Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions on it.  \n\nAt long, the great day dawned. A great school had opened its doors to fresh students to begin the first term. Private cars of all makes, sizes and colours, passenger buses of all brands and shapes and taxi cabs raced from all parts of the ten regions of the country to the school. Students from well-to- do families, looking plump and confident, and their mates from poor backgrounds, were now going to share the same facilities and do everything in common. Now, background, origin, and other social factors that classify people had been set aside. The important fact was that the y had all come to the famous school for one common purpose - to make full use of the special facilities and human resources there. All the new students had been sent there by their parents and guardians to develop their talents as best they could and blossom into useful adults. But they must be moulded by their teachers so that they take up the roles that will be assigned to them in future. Ackon and Asma had arrived there too. A Nissan pick-up, driven by the family driver, had brought them there at 4.26 pm on that great day. As the fresh students had arrived with the school prefect s only, there was not much bullying. Yet one house prefect, to relieve his boredom, unexpectedly picked on poor Ackon and yelled at him. 'Hei, you brat over there, come here, will you?' Ackon hesitated. Asma nudged and eyed him to comply, which he did reluctantly. The prefect gazed at him and said, 'look at his plump cheeks and bulging stomach!' Then he stared at his shoes. 'What quality shoes!', he remarked. 'You must have come from a rich family. What do you say to that?' Ackon calmly replied,' Sir, my family is neither rich nor poor: we're just a hardworking and decent people. We're modest and have sympathy and respect for others...' ' Stop, you parrot. I haven't. asked you to lecture me about your family, you cheeky rat! On this campus all boys are equal , rich or poor, handsome or ugly, tall or short!, Then his humour changed into feigned anger. Now, stand on your right foot and raise your left foot or leg and make 1t parallel to the floor. Raise your left hand and touch your nose with your forefinger!' Ackon was at first completely perplexed. Asma again whispered some instruction to him and he obeyed. Surprisingly, Ackon did not lose his temper. In fact, he realized that he was beginning his lessons on obedience and humility.",

passage: "It was towards dusk one fateful Thursday. A crowd of curious onlookers had gathered in front of Joying Cinema. In the centre was a man dressed in black with a pink band around his head. He held a well-decorated elephant tail and appeared to be a magician. He stood stock-still as he gazed into the sky. After some time, he roused himself from the reverie into which he had fallen and recited some words. Then from nowhere, medium-sized boxes appeared on the ground. The magician explained that the boxes actually contained foreign currency notes. Anyone who wanted, could take any of the boxes for a paltry sum of five cedis. It looked too good to be true. Quite a number of people shied away from the magical sales but still hung around to see what would happen next. Azole emerged from the crowd. You could see from his mode of dressing that he belonged to a high- class society. In my heart of hearts, I felt that a gentleman of his calibre should have kept away from this kind of business. All eyes were fixed on him. He appeared to be firmly resolved to purchase one of the boxes. He stooped low and picked up one, which according to the magician, was a gold mine as it contained priceless materials and therefore, attracted a special price. As if he had been put under a powerful spell, Azole eagerly brought out his fat wallet and paid. A gasp of astonishment escaped from the crowd at the sight of the fresh notes in high denomination. He hurriedly counted the money demanded by the magician and gave it to him. The magician then proceeded to 'bless' the box before Azole could open it. He struck the box three times with his elephant tail while uttering some words in a strange language. Then after the incantations, the magician handed the box to Azole who received it with shaking hands. He opened it and a cry of anguish escaped his lips. On sighting the content which turned out to be camphor, he passed out instantly. When Azole regained consciousness and realized that he had been duped he was bent on confronting the magician, but he was nowhere to be found. His gang had suddenly appeared from nowhere and whisked him away. The crowd laughed wildly and dispersed with such remarks as : 'It serves him right,' 'Never trust a magician,' 'I knew it was a trick from the beginning.",

instruction: "8.	Read the following passage carefully and answer, in your own words as far as possible, the questions on it.",
passage: "There are many potential dangers to the aviation industry. Apart from technical and mechanical faults emanating from the plane, animals like monkeys and birds are also part of the hazard that pilots contend with. Bad weather also hinders the smooth operations of the aviation industry, especially as it affects the flying of planes. It is amazing that birds pose the most serious challenge to flying considering their small size relative to that of a plane. A bird or a flock of birds that suddenly rises from a runway or surrounding area may possibly cause an accident which may damage the engines or body of an aircraft. Although most bird strikes do not result in crashes , they often cause extensive damage to aircraft. Birds have always been a hazard to aircraft from the first powered flight. During the early days of aviation when aircraft flew at low speeds, birds had little difficulty getting out of the way. Now that planes fly at high speed, birds cannot avoid oncoming aircraft. Also, the new turbine engines have light weight parts which can easily be damaged on impact with birds. Airport areas can be both natural and man-made habitats for birds. Most of these habitats abound in a variety of food such as seeds, grass, insects and earthworms which birds feed on. Occasionally, food becomes available through careless waste disposal practices by restaurants in and around the airport. Birds are attracted by pools of water for drinking and bathing. Rainy periods create these temporary pools. Many airports also have permanent water bodies near or between runways for landscaping, flood control and other purposes. These permanent sources of water provide a variety of bird food, including small fish. Other things that attract birds to airport areas are the trees, bushy areas, weed patches, shrubs and airport structures which provide suitable habitats for roosting and nesting. In fact, any area that is free from human disturbance may attract birds. No two airports are exactly alike. Due to that, bird hazards vary from airport to airport, even when the same species are involve. The presence of birds at airports varies according to the environment, weather, season of year and time of day. To ensure successful bird hazard management, waste and refuse disposal within thirteen kilometres radius of the airport should be properly handled. Habitat management practices that make the airport less attractive to birds should be employed. This may include ensuring that rain water is effectively swept or mopped off the runway and aprons, removing or pruning trees and cutting grasses, taking care of foreign objects and debris around the airport.",
