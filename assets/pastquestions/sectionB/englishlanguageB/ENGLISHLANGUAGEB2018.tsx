passage: "When the headmaster announced that an oil company was organizing an essay competition for secondary school students, and that I had been selected as one of the two representatives of my school, I never thought much of it. I was told to report at the auditorium of the largest secondary school in town to compete with others from several secondary schools around. It was a one hour exercise and I wrote just two pages. Although I thoroughly revised my work, I did not think I had as much as an outside chance against those brilliant-looking students from other schools. So, I was surprised when the principal announced some months later that I had come first in the whole region and that the company had invited me for the prize in Accra. Part of the prize was a return ticket. After much eager waiting, the important day came. I took a taxi to the airport, showed my ticket, obtained a boarding pass and waited for the flight. It turned out that I had arrived several hours too early. Hour after expectant hour, planes landed and took off, with passengers embarking and disembarking. The hours of waiting gave me the opportunity to watch the operations at the airport. I praised the ingenuity of the engineers who designed and manufactured the aircraft, and admired the skill of the pilots. In fact, I started the nursing the idea of abandoning my long-cherished ambition of becoming a medical doctor. Finally, the hour came. The public address system announced that passengers for Skybus Flight 456 should commence boarding. I walked out and joined the queue. Final check in did not take much time, in a few minutes I found myself climbing up the steps. Just as I was about to board the plane, I looked back and felt on top of the world. Then, I entered and took my seat beside a window. The seats looked so dainty that I thought the whole arrangements had been made with royalty and nobility in mind. When the one hundred and twenty passengers had been seated, the hostess welcomed us on board, gave us instructions on safety measures, and told us to fasten our seat belts to take-off. Then, the journey commenced as the plane taxied leisurely along the runaway. The huge machine burst into a great speed and then took off. I felt elevated in many ways. I looked out of the window as the houses below appeared to be disappearing behind us. Soon we found ourselves above the clouds. It was all wonderful. Several decades have passed and I still remember every detail.",

passage: "A diet that is rich in vegetables is crucial to man’s life. Vegetables do not only serve as food but also play a medicinal role by supporting the proper functioning of different parts of the body. Some cultures take vegetables as their staple food while others take them as supplement. Either way, vegetables provide human cells with vitamins, minerals, fibre, essential oils and phytonutrients. All these combine to make the body function well. Vegetables are either cooked or eaten raw. They can be prepared as soups, juice or salads. While eating cooked vegetables is healthy, it is more beneficial when eaten raw. However, this is rare in many African cultures. Cooking not only destroys the essential nutrients such as Vitamin C, but it also kills the enzymes that help the body to digest food. Digestion is the breakdown of large molecules of food into smaller particles for effective use by the body. It should be noted that raw vegetables containa lot of nutrients that help the body maintain its system so that a healthy body is built. Vegetables contain low amounts of fat and calories. This makes them a perfect substitute for foods with high calorie content such as carbohydrates and proteins. Researchers recommend substituting high calorie foods such as egg with raw vegetables which are a good source of dietary fibre. They leave man feeling full of energy for long and hence reduce craving because of their fibre contents. Eating foods that are rich in fibre is associated with a lower risk of developing heart ailments. Soluble fibres found in vegetables absorb bile acid and cholesterol which they eliminate from the body. Researchers have shown that water-soluble fibres lower the amount of low density ‘bad cholesterol’ in the blood stream. The cholesterol is ‘bad’ because it sticks to the walls of blood vessels and makes them narrow. The narrowness of the blood vessels creates a passage problem for the flow of blood. The result is that the blood struggles to flow thus leading to cardiovascular diseases. Another study has shown that the cooking of vegetables does not only lower the volume of anti-cancer compounds in the family of vegetables but also makes less potent all other positive aspects of the vegetable to man. Thus, to lower the risk of developing cancer, eating raw vegetables is preferred. Furthermore, it has been established that raw vegetables contain higher amounts of antioxidants such as vitamins C and E, folic acid, lycopene, alpha-carotene and beta-carotene. Vitamins C and E are known to neutralize free radicals and protect the body cells. Lycopene boosts the immune system and also lowers the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Folic acid is essential for the formation of blood cells and proper functioning of the brain and nervous system. Beta-carotene is found in large quantities in many bright-colored vegetables. Beta-carotene among other functions, protects the skin from the sun’s ultra-violet rays. Since this vegetable’s by-product slows down the aging process, it is equally germane to state that it reduces the risk of many diseases associated with old age.",
