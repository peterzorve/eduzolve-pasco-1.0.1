// [Date]
// Dear Mom,
// I hope this letter finds you well. I know you have been concerned about [Sister’s Name]’s decision to marry [Partner’s Name], especially since he comes from a different ethnic group. I want to take a moment to share my thoughts on the matter and offer a perspective that I believe will help you understand why this relationship should be accepted with an open heart.
// 1. Love Knows No Boundaries
// At the core of this decision is love—something that transcends all barriers, including ethnicity. [Sister’s Name] and [Partner’s Name] have found something precious in each other, and their bond is built on mutual respect, shared values, and a deep emotional connection. Love, as we’ve always taught her, should be the foundation of any relationship, and it is this love that will guide them through life together. The strength of their relationship isn’t rooted in their cultural differences but in their respect and care for each other.
// 2. Embracing Diversity Strengthens Us
// As a family, we have always believed in the power of inclusivity and understanding. Marrying someone from a different ethnic group brings opportunities for growth and learning. It’s a chance for all of us to broaden our minds, embrace diversity, and celebrate different traditions and customs. [Partner’s Name] is a kind, hardworking individual with qualities that align with our family values, and his cultural background adds a unique richness to their relationship. I believe we can find joy in this diversity, rather than seeing it as a reason for division.
// 3. The Importance of Support and Unity
// [Sister’s Name] has always been a source of pride for us, and as her family, it is our role to support her in her choices. While we may not fully understand or agree with every aspect of her decision, it is important that we offer her love and acceptance. By standing together as a family and supporting her in this, we show that we trust her judgment and respect her as an individual.

question: "2. The rising incidence of road traffic accidents nowadays is alarming. In an article suitable for publication in an international magazine, discuss at least three factors responsible for this and suggest ways of dealing with the problems.",
definition: [
// The Alarming Rise of Road Traffic Accidents: Causes and Solutions
// In recent years, the increasing number of road traffic accidents has become a global concern. From developing nations to industrialized countries, road traffic accidents are claiming thousands of lives each year and leaving many more individuals injured or disabled. This rise in accidents is due to several factors, and while the situation is troubling, there are effective strategies that can be implemented to reduce these incidents.
// 1. Reckless Driving and Speeding
// One of the leading causes of road traffic accidents is reckless driving, particularly speeding. Many drivers exceed the speed limits, often in urban areas or on highways, putting themselves and others at significant risk. Speeding reduces the driver’s reaction time, increases stopping distances, and worsens the severity of crashes. This behavior is often exacerbated by distractions, such as texting or talking on the phone while driving, further impairing decision-making and control of the vehicle.
// Solution: To address this issue, governments and authorities must enforce stricter speed limits, particularly in high-risk areas such as residential zones and near schools. Additionally, the use of speed cameras and more frequent traffic patrols can deter speeding. Public awareness campaigns and driver education programs can also help drivers understand the importance of maintaining safe speeds.
// 2. Poor Road Infrastructure
// In many parts of the world, inadequate and poorly maintained road infrastructure contributes significantly to road traffic accidents. Potholes, damaged road signs, insufficient lighting, and poorly designed intersections can all lead to dangerous driving conditions. In some cases, the lack of proper pedestrian walkways or cycling lanes increases the likelihood of accidents involving vulnerable road users.
// Solution: Governments and local authorities must prioritize improving road infrastructure. This includes repairing damaged roads, ensuring proper signage, enhancing lighting, and creating safe pedestrian and cyclist pathways. Investments in smart road technologies, such as traffic monitoring systems and real-time hazard alerts, can also improve road safety. Proper road maintenance should be a continuous focus to minimize accidents caused by infrastructure failures.
// 3. Driving Under the Influence
// Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs remains a major factor in road traffic accidents. Drivers impaired by substances have reduced coordination, slower reflexes, and impaired judgment, leading to higher risks of accidents. Despite increased awareness campaigns, the prevalence of drunk driving continues to be a significant global problem, contributing to fatalities and injuries on the roads.
// Solution: Stricter laws against driving under the influence, including severe penalties and fines, must be enforced consistently. The implementation of sobriety checkpoints and random breathalyzer tests can deter individuals from driving after consuming alcohol or drugs. Moreover, promoting the use of designated drivers or ride-sharing services can offer alternatives for those who are under the influence. Public education campaigns aimed at altering attitudes toward drinking and driving are essential in reducing this behavior.
// Conclusion
// The rising incidence of road traffic accidents is a pressing issue that affects individuals, families, and entire societies. Reckless driving, poor road infrastructure, and driving under the influence are some of the main factors contributing to this crisis. However, through a combination of stricter enforcement of traffic laws, investment in better infrastructure, and public education, we can work towards making roads safer for everyone. Governments, organizations, and individuals all have a role to play in reducing accidents and saving lives. It is only through collective action and awareness that we can stem the tide of road traffic accidents and create a safer, more responsible driving culture globally.

question: "3. There has been public outcry against the escalating prices of foodstuffs in your area. Write a letter to your Member of Parliament, stating the causes of the increase and suggesting ways of improving the situation.",
definition: [
// [Your Address]
// [City, State, ZIP Code]
// [Date]
// The Honorable [Member of Parliament's Full Name]
// Member of Parliament
// [Parliament Address]
// [City, State, ZIP Code]
// Dear [Member of Parliament's Last Name],
// Subject: Addressing the Escalating Prices of Foodstuffs in Our Area
// I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my concern, and that of many residents in our area, regarding the recent and alarming rise in food prices. The sharp increase in the cost of basic foodstuffs such as rice, vegetables, and cooking oil has placed a significant burden on families, especially those from low-income households. This issue has sparked widespread frustration and outcry among the public, and I wish to bring it to your attention in the hope that you will consider it a priority in your work.
// Causes of the Price Increase
// There are several factors contributing to the rising food prices in our area:
// Inflation and Economic Instability: The general inflation rate has led to an increase in the prices of goods and services, including food. This economic instability has affected both producers and consumers, pushing food prices beyond the reach of many families.
// Supply Chain Disruptions: There have been significant disruptions in the supply chain, particularly due to global trade issues, transportation difficulties, and the impact of recent natural disasters. These disruptions have limited the availability of foodstuffs and contributed to the increase in prices.
// High Production Costs: The cost of production for local farmers and food processors has risen sharply due to the high cost of fuel, fertilizers, and other essential inputs. As a result, they are forced to pass these costs on to consumers.
// Speculation and Hoarding: In some cases, traders and suppliers are hoarding food to drive up prices in anticipation of further increases. This practice has worsened the situation, making food unaffordable for many.
// Suggestions for Improving the Situation
// To alleviate the hardship caused by rising food prices, I would like to suggest the following actions:
// Subsidies for Local Farmers and Food Producers: The government could introduce subsidies or tax incentives for local farmers and food producers to reduce the cost of production. This would help lower the prices of foodstuffs and encourage domestic production, reducing reliance on imports.
// Investing in Infrastructure: Improving transport and storage infrastructure would help minimize supply chain disruptions and reduce the costs associated with moving food from farms to markets. This would also help prevent food spoilage and waste, which adds to the cost of food.
// Regulation of Food Prices and Monitoring of Speculation: The government could implement temporary price controls on essential food items to prevent unreasonable price hikes. Additionally, stricter regulations should be enforced to curb speculation and hoarding practices by traders, ensuring that food remains affordable for everyone.
// Support for Vulnerable Households: Establishing social safety nets for low-income families, such as food vouchers or direct cash transfers, would help ensure that no one goes hungry due to rising food prices.
// In conclusion, the escalating food prices are putting immense pressure on the people of our area, and urgent action is needed to address this crisis. I sincerely hope that, as our representative, you will take steps to address the causes of this increase and work towards solutions that will ensure that food remains affordable for all.
// Thank you for your time and attention to this important matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon and remain hopeful that positive changes will be made to help those most affected by this issue.
// Yours sincerely,
// [Your Full Name]
// [Your Contact Information]

question: "4. Your school’s Literary and Debating Society has organized a debate on the topic: “The Television is Doing More Harm Than Good to our Youth.” Write your contribution for or against the topic.",
definition: [
// Speech: 'The Television is Doing More Harm Than Good to Our Youth'
// Honorable judges, esteemed members of the opposition, and my fellow debaters,
// I stand before you today to argue for the motion that “The television is doing more harm than good to our youth.” While television undoubtedly has its merits, such as providing entertainment and education, the negative impact it has on our youth is far more significant. The harmful effects of excessive television consumption cannot be ignored, and I believe that it is important to critically examine the consequences it has on our younger generation.
// 1. Exposure to Violence and Inappropriate Content
// One of the most alarming effects of television on young people is the exposure to violence and inappropriate content. Many shows and movies feature graphic violence, explicit language, and unhealthy behaviors, all of which can have a detrimental effect on impressionable minds. Youth who watch violent scenes on television may become desensitized to real-life violence, and in some cases, this may even influence aggressive behavior or the acceptance of violent actions as normal. Research has shown that children who watch high levels of violent television are more likely to exhibit aggressive behavior and have difficulty distinguishing between reality and fiction.
// 2. Negative Influence on Health and Physical Development
// Another area where television does more harm than good is in the physical health of young people. With the rise of binge-watching and screen time, many youths are spending hours glued to the television, often neglecting physical activities, exercise, and outdoor play. This sedentary lifestyle contributes to obesity, poor posture, and a range of other health problems. The addiction to screen time also limits opportunities for social interaction, which is vital for the emotional and psychological well-being of young people. Instead of engaging in physical activities or face-to-face socialization, youth are more often sitting passively in front of a screen, which ultimately affects their overall development.
// 3. Distorted Perceptions and Unrealistic Expectations
// Television shows, especially reality TV and dramas, often portray an idealized, unrealistic version of life. Young people are exposed to distorted beauty standards, exaggerated lifestyles, and unattainable goals. This can lead to low self-esteem, body image issues, and feelings of inadequacy as they compare themselves to the perfect lives they see on screen. The constant bombardment of unrealistic portrayals of success, wealth, and beauty creates pressure on young people to conform to these ideals, even though they are far removed from reality.
// 4. Time Wasted That Could Be Spent Productively
// Finally, excessive television watching often leads to wasted time that could be better spent on more productive activities. Whether it’s homework, reading, learning new skills, or engaging in creative pursuits, there is no shortage of opportunities for young people to use their time more wisely. The lure of endless television programming, however, makes it all too easy to waste hours in front of the screen, leaving little room for personal growth or academic achievement.
// Conclusion
// In conclusion, while television may offer entertainment and education in small doses, its negative effects far outweigh the benefits when consumed excessively. From exposure to violence and inappropriate content to its contribution to poor health and unrealistic expectations, television is doing more harm than good to our youth. We must recognize the dangers of excessive screen time and encourage young people to engage in more meaningful, enriching activities that promote their physical, emotional, and intellectual development.
// Therefore, I firmly believe that television, when not moderated, is a significant contributor to the harm of our youth, and I urge us all to take a critical stance on its impact.
// Thank you.

definition: [
// The Mysterious Stranger
// It was a quiet Sunday afternoon when I met him. I was walking home from the market, my arms full of fresh produce, when I noticed the figure sitting under the old oak tree at the edge of the park. His clothes were disheveled, his hair wild and unkempt, but his eyes were sharp, alert. He looked out of place in the sleepy town of Maplewood, and something about him drew me in.
// He must have seen the curiosity in my eyes, because he spoke first.
// 'Beautiful day, isn't it?' he said with a raspy voice, giving me a small, knowing smile.
// I nodded, unsure of what to make of him. His smile was odd, almost too knowing, as if he could see into my thoughts. I paused for a moment, then decided it couldn’t hurt to engage with him.
// 'Yes, it is,' I replied. 'What brings you here?'
// He gestured vaguely toward the park. 'I travel a lot. I’ve been to many places, seen many things. Some of them... you wouldn’t believe.'
// I chuckled nervously. 'I’m sure they were fascinating.'
// He leaned forward, his eyes glinting. 'You want to know something truly unbelievable?' His voice dropped to a whisper. 'I’ve seen the future.'
// I raised an eyebrow. 'The future?'
// He nodded solemnly. 'Yes. And I can tell you exactly what’s going to happen to you.'
// I hesitated. 'I don’t know... I mean, how would you even know something like that?'
// The man gave a small, knowing smile again. 'I’ve seen it all. I could tell you your future, every detail. The choices you’ll make, the people you’ll meet, the things you’ll experience. All of it. For a price, of course.'
// I was skeptical but intrigued. 'What kind of price?'
// 'Nothing too heavy,' he said. 'Just trust me, and I’ll reveal the truth. You’ll never be the same again. It’ll change your life.'
// Against my better judgment, curiosity got the better of me. 'Alright,' I said, trying to sound more confident than I felt. 'Tell me my future then.'
// He leaned in closer, his voice barely above a whisper. 'In the next few months, you will face a great challenge. It will be something that makes you question everything. But don’t worry—there is someone close to you who will help you through it. You just have to listen carefully when they speak.'
// I was taken aback. That sounded so specific. Was it a coincidence, or had he truly seen something? Still, I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off.
// He stood up suddenly, his expression more intense now. 'Remember, trust the one who speaks the truth to you. They will guide you.'
// And just like that, he turned and walked away, disappearing down the path without a sound.
// In the weeks that followed, I couldn’t shake his words from my mind. I waited for the challenge he mentioned, but it never came. Life went on as usual. No great revelation, no dramatic turning point. The mysterious stranger's words seemed to fade into the background of my everyday life.
// Then, one day, as I was walking through the park again, I saw him sitting under the oak tree once more. This time, I didn’t approach. I kept walking, but something made me glance back. I caught sight of him smiling—an eerie, unsettling smile that made my stomach turn.
// I felt a strange compulsion to walk over and confront him. As I got closer, I suddenly remembered something: his words had never quite made sense. He hadn’t given me any concrete details about my future, just vague promises and cryptic advice.
// When I finally reached him, he looked up, eyes gleaming with recognition.
// 'You were right,' I said, feeling a strange sense of unease. 'Nothing happened. There was no great challenge, no truth revealed.'
// He just smiled, that same cryptic smile. 'You were always the one to decide your path.'
// I frowned. 'What do you mean? You said you could tell me my future.'
// He shrugged, as if indifferent. 'Sometimes, we all make our own futures, whether we realize it or not.'
// The air felt thick with tension. My mind was racing, and suddenly, the whole encounter seemed absurd. Had he really known anything? Or was it all just a game?
// And then it hit me. I had allowed myself to believe him, to trust his mysterious words, without questioning the truth of his claims.
// Had I known, I wouldn’t have believed him.

passage: "When health workers first came to the village and talked about family planning, no one took them seriously, including Amusa, whose young wife was then pregnant with their first baby. Had their fathers and forefathers before them not had as many wives and children as they desired? And have they not been able to take care of their families? So everyone shunned the family planning clinic which was established in the village shortly afterwards. Twelve years later, Amusa was a clerical assistant in the city and lived with his wife and eight children in a single room because he could not afford larger quarters. For as long as he could remember, his large family had been going through difficult times, which appeared to be worsening lately. Only yesterday, his third child had been sent away from school because her parents could not replace her old torn school uniform. Last year, their first son could not proceed to the secondary school as the family could not afford the cost. Then recently, the landlord had announced his intention to increase the rent. Amusa found himself thinking about the days when he himself was a young child. His own father had two wives and thirteen children, yet as far as he could remember, the family had not faced anything similar to what he was going through now. He suddenly realized that this was because the times had changed and that the requirements of modern living put great pressure on large family sizes. His father’s time and age had been different: he had been a successful farmer in the village, had lived in his own house, employed members of his large family as farm hands and fed everyone from the abundance of the farm. On the other hand, Amusa lived in the city on a limited income. He had no farm land nor even a vegetable garden, and had to pay for everything, from his rented room to the smallest domestic needs of his family. And at four times what they cost a few years before! It was then that he sadly remembered the health workers and their gospel of family planning. How he wished he had listened and taken their advice! Unfortunately, he had not.

passage: "The great white shark is at the top of the marine food chain. In the shark family, it is the king, it will eat anything, even other sharks. But as it gets older, bigger and slower, it develops a preference for seals, penguins and carrion, especially dead whales. In locating their food, most sharks use all their senses, including excellent vision. Their sense of smell is incredible and their ears are aided by pressure-sensitive cells along each side of their body. Nothing escapes this eavesdropping system, which is attuned to vibrations in the water. Sharks also have a sixth sense which enables them to detect the weak electrical fields emanating from the beating heart or the swimming muscles of a potential prey. The white shark’s most fearsome assets are its huge head, its black eyes, and its razor-sharp serrated teeth. The circulatory system of the white shark is different from that of most other sharks. Its blood temperature is about three to five degrees Celsius above water temperature, which speeds up digestion and adds to its strength and endurance. \n It is known that the white shark pits out its wounded prey after an initial, powerful bite. Then it waits for the victim to die before eating it. Why does it use this bite-and-spit strategy? Experts speculate that this is because of its eyes. Unlike other sharks, the white shark no eyelid-like membrane to protect its eyes, rather, it rotates them in their sockets when a collision is imminent. At the moment of impact, the eye is left exposed, perhaps to the flying claws of a seal. Therefore, for the white shark, a quick mortal strike and release is common behaviour. The public image of sharks has been greatly coloured by the novel Jaws, which was turned into a popular movie. Overnight, the white shark became evil incarnate. However, it is not a demon craving human flesh. The smell of blood does not drive it into a frenzy as it does certain other sharks.

passage: "Scientists have made spectacular advances in genetic engineering in the last fifty years. The benefits of this genetic revolution to mankind are immense and almost limitless. In the field of medicine, many of the diseases that have hitherto proved incurable can now be eradicated using genetic engineering. It is now possible to identify the specific gene responsible for any given disease and to replace the diseased gene with a healthy one. This new technology can now be used to cure such serious diseases as diabetes, sickle-cell anemia and cancer. Geneticists (specialists in genetic science) claim that there are several other medical benefits that can be derived from this new science. They assert that by increasing the neurons in the brain, we slow down the ageing process. Scientists are on the threshold of being able to redesign the human body to make it function more effectively. This interesting aspect of preventive of preventive medicine involves the intervention of the doctor to ensure that the fetus contains no diseased gene that can develop into a disease later on. Moreover scientists can now build or develop organs for transplant surgery. Patients who need heart surgery or kidney transplant no longer have to wait endlessly for donors or be worried that the donated organs would be rejected by their body’s immune system. Perhaps the greatest benefits of the genetic revolution are in the areas of crop and livestock production. Cloning or the creation of a new plant or animal from the genetic information carried in one cell, has already been done with plants and animals. The result is the production of grains that yield their own fertilizer or can be grown in factories without sunshine and soil. Already in the United States of America, genetically modified (GM) potatoes, tomatoes, apples, etc. are on sale in supermarkets. The main difference between these GM products and their conventionally produced counterparts is that the former are usually bigger and have a longer shelf-life than the latter. Consequently, most shoppers would rather go for the GM products, other things being equal. GM livestock are usually a good bargain. Imagine being offered a chicken the size of turkey or a sheep almost a cow! If the price and the taste are comparable the housewife would naturally prefer the GM breed, just as we now prefer the so-called “Agric” fowls to our smaller local breed. There are, however, serious potential dangers. The greatest risk is the escape – by accident or by design – of harmful microbes from the laboratory into a world that has no defenses against them. Some scientists have speculated that the HIV virus may have originated from such an accidental escape. The world has not the case of Adolf Hitler who, in furtherance of this project of creating “a superior” race abused scientific knowledge and plunged the world into World War II. For this reason, many governments have been cautious, or even reluctant, to give the geneticists the necessary approval to implement the results of their researches.
