// [Your Address]

// [Date]
// Dear [Brother's Name],
// I hope this letter finds you well. I hear you are about to begin your journey into secondary school, and I wanted to take a moment to share some thoughts with you as you embark on this exciting new chapter. Secondary school will be an exciting and transformative experience, but like any major change, it will come with its challenges. Below are three common problems that you might face, along with some suggestions on how to deal with them.
// 1. Managing Time and Homework
// One of the biggest challenges in secondary school is managing your time effectively, especially when it comes to handling the workload. You will likely have more homework and assignments than you did in primary school, and it may feel overwhelming at times.
// Solution: My advice is to keep a planner or timetable where you can write down all your tasks, deadlines, and activities. Break down large assignments into smaller, manageable tasks, and always try to do your homework early so you don't have to rush at the last minute. Make sure to set aside time for breaks, so you don’t burn out. Managing your time well will help you stay on top of everything.
// 2. Peer Pressure and Social Challenges
// As you enter secondary school, you will meet many new people, and sometimes it may be hard to navigate the different social dynamics. Peer pressure, bullying, or the desire to fit in might be challenges you'll face. You may feel the need to conform to what others are doing, even if it goes against your values or beliefs.
// Solution: It's important to remember that you don’t have to do anything you’re uncomfortable with just to fit in. Stay true to yourself and always choose friends who support you for who you are. If you ever face any difficult situations, don't hesitate to talk to a teacher or a trusted adult. They are there to help. Being confident in your own choices will help you stay grounded.
// 3. Staying Focused in Class
// The transition from primary school to secondary school can be a big leap. In secondary school, the pace is faster, and you may find it harder to stay focused in class, especially with so many subjects and teachers to manage. It can be easy to become distracted by friends or other things going on around you.
// Solution: To stay focused, try sitting at the front of the class where you can pay better attention. Take notes during lessons, even if you don’t think you’ll need them immediately. Notes are a great way to stay engaged, and they will be helpful when it’s time to revise. If you don’t understand something, don’t hesitate to ask questions or seek help from your teachers after class. Being proactive in your learning will help you stay on track.
// I know that entering secondary school can feel a little intimidating, but remember, it's all part of growing up. You'll face challenges, but with determination, patience, and a positive mindset, you'll be able to overcome them. Most importantly, enjoy the journey! It's a time of discovery and growth, and I know you’ll do great.
// Best of luck, and don’t forget, I’m always here if you need advice or someone to talk to.
// With love,
// [Your Name]

question: "2. Write an article for publication in your school magazine on “The evil effects of examination malpractice in our society.”",
definition: [
// The Evil Effects of Examination Malpractice in Our Society
// Examination malpractice has become a growing concern in schools and educational institutions across the globe. What was once a rare occurrence has now become widespread, with many students resorting to dishonest means to pass their exams. Whether it’s cheating, bribery, or impersonation, examination malpractice undermines the core values of education and has several damaging effects on individuals and society as a whole.
// 1. Undermines Academic Integrity
// Examination malpractice undermines the very foundation of academic integrity. Exams are meant to assess a student’s understanding of the material and their ability to apply what they have learned. When students engage in malpractice, they bypass the learning process, which results in a hollow achievement. This encourages a culture of dishonesty, where the emphasis is placed on the outcome rather than the effort, which is a disservice to the student’s true potential.
// Students who indulge in malpractice may temporarily gain high grades, but these grades are meaningless because they do not reflect the student’s knowledge or abilities. As a result, they miss out on the real purpose of education—gaining skills and knowledge that will be useful in life.
// 2. Damages the Education System
// Examination malpractice doesn’t only harm individual students, but it also damages the education system as a whole. When students cheat and pass their exams fraudulently, the system loses its credibility. Teachers, administrators, and educational bodies invest considerable time and effort in developing fair assessments, and when these efforts are compromised, it diminishes the value of the education provided.
// Furthermore, examination malpractice may lead to the admission of students into higher institutions who are not adequately prepared for the challenges ahead. This, in turn, can result in high dropout rates, poor performance in higher education, and ultimately, a workforce that lacks the necessary skills to contribute effectively to society.
// 3. Promotes a Culture of Corruption
// Examination malpractice, like any other form of corruption, creates an environment where dishonesty is accepted and even encouraged. When students witness their peers cheating or bribing their way through exams, they may feel that such behavior is acceptable or necessary to succeed. This mentality can permeate other areas of life, leading to widespread corruption in various sectors such as politics, business, and government.
// A society that tolerates examination malpractice is one that turns a blind eye to other forms of corruption. This perpetuates a cycle of dishonesty that becomes increasingly difficult to break.
// 4. Erodes Personal Development and Character
// Education is not just about acquiring knowledge; it is also about personal growth, building character, and developing good values. When students engage in malpractice, they bypass the opportunity to develop traits such as discipline, patience, and resilience, which are essential for success in life.
// By taking shortcuts, students fail to develop problem-solving skills and a strong work ethic, which are crucial for tackling real-life challenges. In the long run, this lack of character development may hinder their success in their careers and personal lives.
// 5. Leads to Legal Consequences
// Examination malpractice is illegal in many countries and can result in severe consequences for those involved. Students caught cheating may face suspension, expulsion, or even legal charges. The ramifications of malpractice can extend beyond the individual to their families, as a tarnished reputation can affect their future opportunities and career prospects.
// Conclusion
// Examination malpractice may offer temporary relief, but its long-term effects are deeply damaging to both individuals and society. It undermines the integrity of the education system, promotes corruption, erodes character development, and can result in legal consequences. As students, we must understand that true success comes from hard work, honesty, and dedication. Let us strive to uphold the values of academic integrity, not only for our own personal growth but for the betterment of our society as a whole.
// The fight against examination malpractice begins with each one of us. By choosing honesty, we contribute to building a society where merit, hard work, and integrity are valued above all else.

question: "3. Write a letter to your local Government Authority commenting on three health hazards in your area – make suggestions as to how the situation can be improved.",

// [Date]
// The Local Government Authority
// [Local Government Office Address]
// [City, State, ZIP Code]
// Dear Sir/Madam,
// Subject: Health Hazards in Our Area and Suggestions for Improvement
// I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to draw your attention to three significant health hazards in our area that are becoming a growing concern for residents. These issues not only pose risks to the well-being of the people but also contribute to a deteriorating environment. I urge the Local Government Authority to take immediate action to address these problems.
// 1. Poor Sanitation and Waste Management
// One of the most pressing health hazards in our area is the poor state of sanitation and waste management. Garbage is often left uncollected for days, and waste disposal bins are either insufficient or improperly placed. As a result, waste accumulates in open areas, leading to the breeding of mosquitoes and other pests, which increases the risk of diseases such as malaria, cholera, and dysentery.
// Suggestion: I recommend that the Local Government increase the number of waste collection points and ensure that garbage is collected regularly. Additionally, public awareness campaigns about proper waste disposal practices should be implemented to encourage residents to keep their surroundings clean.
// 2. Open Sewage and Blocked Drains
// Another major health hazard is the presence of open sewage and blocked drains in some parts of our area. These drains often overflow during the rainy season, creating a breeding ground for waterborne diseases. The exposure to untreated sewage not only poses a direct risk to public health but also creates an unpleasant living environment for residents.
// Suggestion: Immediate action should be taken to repair and maintain the sewage system, as well as clear any blocked drains. Regular cleaning and inspection of these systems are essential to prevent overflow and contamination of water sources. In addition, the construction of proper sewage lines in underserved areas should be prioritized.
// 3. Poor Air Quality and Traffic Pollution
// The increasing number of vehicles in our area has led to poor air quality, particularly around major roads and markets. This pollution has contributed to respiratory problems, especially among children and the elderly, who are more vulnerable to conditions such as asthma and bronchitis.
// Suggestion: To improve air quality, I propose that the Local Government Authority invest in public transportation systems that reduce reliance on private vehicles. Additionally, the establishment of more green spaces and the planting of trees along busy streets will help absorb some of the pollutants in the air. Enforcing stricter regulations on vehicle emissions and promoting the use of cleaner energy sources will also help reduce traffic-related pollution.
// Conclusion
// The health hazards in our area are a growing concern that requires urgent action. Addressing poor sanitation, open sewage, and traffic pollution will significantly improve the quality of life for residents and reduce the risk of diseases. I trust that the Local Government Authority will consider these suggestions and take prompt steps to improve the health and well-being of our community.
// Thank you for your time and attention to this important matter. I look forward to seeing positive changes in our area soon.
// Yours faithfully,
// [Your Full Name]
// [Your Contact Information]

question: "4. You are the main speaker in an inter-schools debate. Write your speech for or against the motion: 'Corrupt public officers too deserve capital punishment'",
definition: [
// Speech Against the Motion: "Corrupt Public Officers Too Deserve Capital Punishment"
// Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, distinguished teachers, and my dear fellow students,
// I stand before you today to firmly oppose the motion: “Corrupt public officers too deserve capital punishment.” While corruption in public office is indeed a grave problem that undermines the integrity of governments, societies, and economies, we must not allow ourselves to be swept away by emotion or haste when addressing such issues. The suggestion that corrupt public officers deserve capital punishment is not only morally flawed but also dangerous to the principles of justice and human rights. Let me outline several key reasons why capital punishment is not an appropriate or effective response to corruption.
// 1. The Inhumanity of Capital Punishment
// First and foremost, the death penalty is a clear violation of the fundamental human right to life. Every person, regardless of their actions, retains the inherent right to life, and no government or authority has the moral right to take that away. Corruption is undoubtedly a crime, but it is not a crime that justifies the irreversible punishment of death. Even if we were to agree that corruption is harmful to society, it should not be equated with the kind of brutality that the death penalty entails. The idea that public officers who engage in corruption should be executed is an extreme position that disregards the value of human life.
// 2. The Fallibility of the Justice System
// Even the best judicial systems are not immune to mistakes. Wrongful convictions, misidentifications, and miscarriages of justice are unfortunate realities in many legal systems. If we were to implement capital punishment for corrupt public officers, there would always be the risk that innocent individuals—who were wrongly accused or unjustly prosecuted—might be executed. We cannot afford to make such a fatal error, as the consequences of an irreversible mistake are far too high. No society should be willing to risk the execution of innocent people, especially when it comes to issues as complex as corruption.
// 3. The Ineffectiveness of Capital Punishment in Deterring Corruption
// Proponents of the death penalty may argue that it would deter corruption among public officers, but evidence suggests otherwise. Countries that impose the death penalty do not necessarily have lower rates of corruption. Corruption is deeply rooted in systemic issues such as poor governance, lack of transparency, and weak institutions. Simply imposing a severe punishment, such as capital punishment, does not address these root causes. To effectively combat corruption, we must focus on strengthening our institutions, promoting transparency, ensuring accountability, and providing proper education and training for public officers. The focus should be on creating a fair, just, and efficient system, not on administering extreme punishments.
// 4. Alternative, More Effective Solutions
// Instead of turning to the death penalty, there are more humane and practical ways to address corruption. Public officers found guilty of corruption can be sentenced to long prison terms, forced to pay restitution, or banned from holding public office. These measures not only serve justice but also allow for rehabilitation, which is a crucial aspect of a fair legal system. Moreover, a robust anti-corruption framework that encourages reporting, monitoring, and accountability, along with the establishment of independent bodies to investigate corruption, will help reduce the prevalence of the crime. By promoting the rule of law and ensuring the effective enforcement of existing legal frameworks, we can address corruption more constructively.
// 5. The Risk of Abuse of Power
// Finally, we must consider the risk of power being abused if we grant the state the authority to execute corrupt public officers. Throughout history, regimes have used capital punishment as a political tool to silence opposition, eliminate rivals, or settle personal grudges. If we allow the death penalty for corruption, there is a real danger that it could be misused by corrupt or authoritarian regimes to eliminate political opponents or dissenters under the guise of combating corruption. This would only worsen the problem of injustice and perpetuate cycles of abuse and oppression.
// Conclusion
// In conclusion, while corruption is undoubtedly a serious crime that must be dealt with firmly, capital punishment is neither an ethical nor an effective solution. The death penalty violates the fundamental right to life, risks wrongful convictions, does not address the root causes of corruption, and may lead to the abuse of power by authorities. Instead, we must focus on creating a justice system that promotes accountability, transparency, and fair treatment, while also offering opportunities for reform and rehabilitation. Let us not be swayed by the emotional appeal of extreme measures but instead advocate for a society rooted in justice, fairness, and human dignity.
// Thank you.

definition: [
// The Fall of the Cheat
// Once, in a small town, there lived a boy named Matthew. He was known for his intelligence, and everyone expected him to do great things. But Matthew had one flaw: he believed that success came easy, and he wasn't afraid to take shortcuts to achieve it. His grades were always impressive, his reputation in school was flawless, and he managed to stay on top in every class. However, what no one knew was that Matthew was not as diligent as he appeared. Behind his impressive marks was a network of cheating, dishonesty, and deceit.
// It began innocently enough. In his first year of secondary school, Matthew realized that the pressure to do well in exams was mounting. He had always been good at his studies, but now, with the demands of his coursework, he found it hard to keep up. His friends noticed how he started to rely on textbooks and notes hidden in his desk during exams, copying from classmates, and sometimes even bribing others to give him answers.
// The teachers, though dedicated, couldn't always catch him. Matthew’s charm and cleverness allowed him to slip through unnoticed, and each success built his confidence. He believed that as long as he didn’t get caught, he was winning. So, he continued to cheat, every test, every assignment, never once thinking about the consequences.
// As Matthew progressed through his years at school, his deceit grew bolder. He started to manipulate situations to his advantage, even sabotaging his classmates’ chances to succeed. If someone performed well in a subject, he’d find a way to discredit them, making sure they got less recognition for their hard work. He was constantly plotting and scheming, all for the sake of maintaining his status as the top student in the class.
// However, one fateful day, Matthew’s luck ran out. The school had introduced a new system that involved surprise spot checks on students' exam papers. Matthew thought he could outsmart this as well, but it wasn’t long before a teacher noticed something suspicious. During one of the checks, Matthew was caught with a piece of paper stuffed in his pocket, containing answers that were clearly not his own. The teacher’s face turned pale as she confronted him. The room fell silent as Matthew’s mind raced, realizing that everything he had worked for was now crumbling before him.
// He was called into the headmaster’s office, where his parents and teachers were waiting. The evidence against him was overwhelming, and there was no way he could talk his way out of this. His reputation, once spotless, was shattered. He had been expelled from the school, and the news spread quickly, tainting his name across the town. The very people who had once admired him now saw him for what he truly was—a cheater.
// As time passed, Matthew struggled to come to terms with what had happened. He couldn’t enroll in any other school, and the doors to many opportunities closed before him. His former classmates, who had once envied his success, now moved on, achieving things Matthew had only dreamed of, all while working honestly and diligently. Matthew, on the other hand, was left to face the consequences of his actions.
// He had thought that cheating would give him a shortcut to success, but it had only led him down a path of disgrace and failure. He had taken the easy route, but it had come at a steep price. The lesson Matthew learned too late was simple: success built on lies will never last.
// In the end, Matthew had no one to blame but himself. He reaped what he sowed.

passage: "Among the giraffes, zebra and gazelles that roam the vast African savanna, perhaps the most remarkable creature is the ostrich. Standing about 2.5 metres tall and weighing up to 155 kilograms, the ostrich is the largest bird in existence. No one can fail to be awed and fascinated by the bird’s great height, powerful legs and beautiful fluffy feathers. Like the camel, the ostrich is tolerant of high temperatures and thrives in desert country. It also has long luxuriant eyelashes, which protect its large eyes from the dust of the bushveld. Its legs are long and sinewy and its feet are strong and fleshy. Seeing the ostrich strutting about in the open plains, observers are amazed at its agility and endurance. The ostrich is omnivorous, feeding on almost anything that creeps or crawls. It also dines on insects, snakes, rodents and most vegetation. Because of its great size and weight, it cannot fly. However, its muscular legs are powerful enough to make it one of the fastest creatures on earth. Running across desert country, it can attain speed of up to 65 kilometres an hour! This extraordinary swiftness and its long-distance stamina enable it to outrun many of the fastest four-legged predators with ease. The eggs of the ostrich are the largest in the world and can weigh up to 1.5 kilograms each. Prized for its size and delicious taste each egg is the equivalent to 25 hens’ eggs. The shell is hard and glossy and has a glazed porcelain-like finish. The empty shell is sometimes used as a container by Bushmen for storing water. \n\nIn the 14th century, ostrich feathers became highly valued by fashion-conscious Europeans. Yet hunting the ostrich was not easy, since the bird has very keen eyesight and swiftly flees from danger. Consequently, the ostrich was in no danger of extinction at that time. But in the 19th century, armed with modern weapons, hunters slaughtered ostriches by the millions. And today the noble ostrich has become an endangered species.",

Ibezim was the chief priest of Ani, the earth goddess, in Ndiuzo, and although the District Officer was stationed in far-away Umueke, and the chief priest by his calling should not travel out of Ndiuzo, their relationship remained as solid as a rock. They became friends after Ibezim had testified before the District Officer in the land dispute Ndiuzo and Umueke. He was the only man to testify against his people in the dispute, and had struck the District Officer as an honest man who was telling the truth. That was what earned Ibezim the admiration and friendship of the District Officer. Consequently, the District Officer advised him to send his son to the new school and the new religion that held out so much promise of positive change in the future. And when the system of indirect rule necessitated the appointment of a Warrant Chief at Ndiuzo, the District Officer again promptly thought of his honest friend as the most suitable candidate. On the other hand, Ibezim’s testimony in the land dispute earned him the wrath of many of his own people. They not only held him responsible for their loss of the disputed land but also resented his friendship with the District Officer and his patronage of the new education and religion, which was threatening to erode the old ways of the land. Therefore, when the District Officer wanted Chief Ibezim at Umueke, and he sought to confer with his people on what to do, his detractors quickly turned their backs on him and left him alone in his dilemma. Some even secretly hoped that he was going to be arrested and detained. After a long period of hesitation, Ibezim finally decided to break with tradition and go to Umueke.

passage: "The dramatic increase in life expectancy globally towards the end of the twentieth century has renewed interest among scientists and laymen alike in the subject of longevity and the aging process. This lengthening of life expectancy has been one of the greatest achievements of humanity. It was in recognition of this fact that the United Nations formally designated 1999 as the “International Year of Older Persons”. Demographers tell a surprising story: octogenarians and older people, instead of the young, now form the fastest-growing population group on earth. What then are the factors that determine man’s health and the length of his life? Recent studies have identified some of these. It is known that the sounder your habits the longer your life may last. Nutritionists have told us that we are what we eat, that is to say, that what we eat influences the state of our health. Instead of over-eating, one should eat a balanced diet including fruit and plenty of vegetables. Moderate physical exercise on a regular basis is of immense benefit. The family doctor should be consulted on how much exercise and what type are most appropriate for each individual. Studies have shown that simple exercise in and around the home help the elderly to regain strength and vitality. The adage “use it or lose it” applies not only to the muscles but also to the mind. Mental exercise keeps the brain’s “telephone lines” alive whereas mental decline or senility starts the moment a person retires and decides to take things easy in the erroneous belief that he doesn’t have to keep up with the world anymore. Many retired civil servants fall into this bad habit. They can change this unhealthy habit by being actively engaged in reading, travel, education, clubs, professional associations etc. It is believed that such activities not only lift the spirit but also “rewire” the brain. In addition to these in the environment. In many developing countries, the environment poses grave dangers to health, often resulting in preventable deaths. Access to clean safe water is severely limited. There are huge mountains of refuse breeding vermin, cockroaches and disease-causing germs in both rural and urban areas. All this contributes to the low life expectancy in these countries. Better sanitation, safer water for all and a reduction of vermin in the home will improve man’s environment, bolster his health and extend his life span. The next factor is the state of medical care available in our countries. In the developed countries, advances in medical science have dramatically improved health care delivery. Unfortunately, the reverse has been the case in the poor countries of Africa and Asia. For example, in the USA, only one woman in 12,500 dies from pregnancy-related causes whereas one in 21 dies in Africa from the same cause! That speaks volumes about the deplorable state of our medical services. Finally, man has made a breakthrough in controlling his genetic make-up. A decade or so ago, he had no control whatsoever over his genetic engineering. Now, he can redesign his genetic constitution to ensure better health and longer life.",
