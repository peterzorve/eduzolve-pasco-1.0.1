passage: "The chalkboard is by far the commonest teaching aid used at virtually all levels of education from the nursery to the university. It is the most enduring teaching aid and perhaps will be the most difficult to replace. In the advanced countries of the world, it is being threatened by the overhead projector. However, the overhead projector requires constant supply of electricity- which is one reason we cannot rely on it yet. The chalkboard used to be black, which was why the name blackboard' stuck for ages; but today, there are boards of various colours: blue, green, even white. Now, most chalkboards are made of wood nailed to the wall, instead of the concrete board made of cement and fine sand that was more common. Some are also made of metal. The chalkboard has the advantages of low cost, availability and ease of maintenance, usually involving mere cleaning and occasional retouching of the surface with the renovator. However, if the board is metal, the felt marker should be protected against drying by replacing the cap when it is not in use. The major draw back in the use of the chalkboard is that the information on it can only be temporary. If there is only one board for the class, it is usually impossible to leave the information there for more than a few hours, since other teachers would want to use it. It is not easy to draw complex diagrams showing minute details, such as parts of the body and contours, unless one is a good artist. Where one has succeeded with laborious illustrations, using different colours, it could be painful when the board has to be cleaned by the next teacher. However, there are nowadays various innovations, including foldable boards made of plywood, which allow teachers more room to leave their materials for longer periods. Finally, it is a great disadvantage that during the course of teaching, more time is spent writing on the board than when one is using overhead projector. So, in all, more time needed for any lesson when one uses the board rather than the overhead projector.",

passage: "Dele groaned and got out of bed. There was no clock on the mantelpiece and the room was still dark, but he knew that he was already late for work, probably by up to an hour. He was a commercial bus driver and had to get started as early as 5.00 a.m. and go almost non-stop until about 9.00 p.m. to be able to make the daily returns that the bus owner demanded. On the previous day, he had attended an all-night party -a late uncle's burial ceremony- where he had drunk himself almost senseless before crawling home on his face and hurried off to work, but not before carefully fastening on his upper left arm the amulet he had always worn for protection against accident. A similar amulet hung concealed under the steering column of his bus. On his way, still feeling groggy, he caught his left toe against a stump and had some misgiving. It was a bad sign, and he was supposed to go back home and then set out again. eut there was no time for that now, so he hurried on. At the bus station, Dele quickly loaded his bus and sped off without any of the necessary checks on the vehicle. He had to make up for lost time. It was the rush hour, so the bus was overloaded as it often was, with many passengers hanging on to the doors. The tyres were threadbare the brakes were faulty and the road was wet, but, still feeling a little sleepy, Dele sped on. Many passengers protested about his reckless driving, but he would not listen. After all, didn't he have protection against accident? As the vehicle took the last turn before its destination, Dele saw a broken-doom truck blocking his side of the road. Under normal circumstances, he could have brought the bus safely to a halt, but the circumstances were far from normal. The careening bus hit the parked vehicle, swerved wildly across the road and plunged into a ditch. Dele's surprise before he sank into oblivion was the failure of his supposed protective amulets",

section: "SUMMARY",
instruction: "8. Read the following carefully and answer the questions on it.",
passage: "You cannot expect to go through life without meeting problems. Difficulties, perplexities and frustrations are an inevitable part of human experience. Accepting this idea of the inevitability of problems will help you to approach them in a robust frame of mind rather than thinking that you are a victim specially singled t by a malignant fate. When confronted with a problem, the first thing to do is to gather all relevant data to get acquainted with all the facts of the case. Then write down exactly what the problem is, stating it simply in black and white. This gives you something definite with which to come to terins. The problem is assessed and you will now have something concrete to deal with. Next, give serious thought to the problem, making sure that such thought does not degenerate into worry as worry accomplishes nothing. Aim at clear, dispassionate thought, viewing the problem as if it were friend's and not your own. Look at it from all angles and from the view point of all concerned. You court disaster if you are entirely selfish in your outlook. The single important purpose of all this is to discover all possible solutions to the problem. Having examined the problem broadly and impartially, carefully examine all the possible solutions or courses of action, the knowledge that you have done; this will keep you from useless regrets later, when you can remind yourself that all possible courses of action were examined and you chose what appeared to be the best. Next, eliminate all proposed solutions which are seen on further thought to be impracticable. You will now find that your list has been whittled down to two or three possibilities. At this stage it is often a good plan to get out into the open air. Go far a walk or a ride, preferably somewhere with wide horizons. There out in the open, review the problem afresh. You will find it appears much less formidable. Ask yourself how the difficulty will appear in ten years' time, or even one! This fresh review will enable you to make a final choice as you turn to the remaining solutions and, before you return home, decide which you are going to adopt. As you go to sleep that night, let your last thoughts be upon your decision. If, in the morning, you still feel it is the best one to take, go ahead. If you have a friend you think is capable of giving sound advice, consult him. Do this before, our final decision, so that you will have the benefit of his views before you decide. Talking things over with another is always great help. It enables you to isolate the problem and to decide which are the important factors. Even if the friend offers no advice, a sympathetic word will help you, you will see them in a clearer light. Alternatively, one will appear most attractive. Some will appear impossible even while you speak. In dealing with problems, remember the time factor. Although some problems solve themselves in time, and delaying tactics are therefore the best form of action for them, most other problems generally get more complicated the longer they are left. You should therefore get to grips with problems immediately they occur. All told, reasonable foresight and imagination can prevent many problems ever arising. Tact, thoughtfulness and responsible conduct can also keep life largely problem-free.",
