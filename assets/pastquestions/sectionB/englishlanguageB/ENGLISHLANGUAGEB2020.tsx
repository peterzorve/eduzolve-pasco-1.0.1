passage: "Uncle Ben had three nicknames: “Travel and See”, “Land Seaman” and “Old Salt”. Apparently, he enjoyed being called by those names because he invariably	responded with either a wave or a big smile. He loved his village. Although people his age had left in search of greener pastures, Uncle Ben had resolved to live and die in his village. He had a morbid feeling about crossing the river near his village in the small canoes that were available. Almost every child of school-age could swim like a fish and paddle a canoe like a seasoned sailor, but not Uncle Ben. He had an inordinate fear of travelling by water. The root cause of his problem was the numerous adventure stories his grandfather had fold him. The most scary one was about how he had escaped by a hair's breadth when their boat had capsized, His grandfather, the only survivor, had to cling to a fragment of the boat until a rescue party arrived. However. all that changed when one of his cousins, a sailor, returned home from one of his trips abroad. There was a remarkable change in his appearance. He looked groomed and quite rich. He gave expensive gifts to every member of his family, He paid all the school fees arrears of his siblings and rehabilitated his parents' ramshackle house. Uncle Ben was so impressed that he made up his mind to follow in his cousin's footsteps. Uncle Ben, therefore, appealed to his cousin to take him along. He turned a deaf ear to the protests and pleadings from his parents and siblings. His cousin managed to secure a job for him as a cabin boy on the ship he worked in. Narrating his experiences in a letter to his younger brother, Uncle Ben wrote, “For more than two weeks after we had set sail, I could do nothing. Whenever I tried to walk, I had some queasy feelings and the whole world danced before my eyes. On several occasions, I threw up. The salty biting winds drew tears from my eyes……” His cousin was very supportive. He took care of him and explained to him that every seafarer felt seasick on his maiden voyage. Gradually, he adjusted to the environment and began to enjoy his trips. They sailed to different parts of the world. Whenever he went home on leave, he recounted the exciting stories about his experiences. He always ended such narrations with, ‘travel and see.” When Uncle Ben retired, he invested in farming and bought two big motor-boats to ferry the people across the river. Although he had been home for more than two decades, Uncle Ben still swaggered as if he was in a ship on the sea; hence the nickname, “Land Seaman” or “Old Salt”.",

instruction: "7. Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions on it.",
passage: "Nowadays, technology has taken over virtually every area of our lives. One remarkable manifestation of this “colonization” is the social media such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. Social media platforms can only be accessed via computers and handheld devices such as phones and tablets that are connected to the Internet. These devices can be purchased at affordable prices. With the advent of modern-day communication outlets, conventional media such as the radio, television and newspaper are increasingly trailing behind social media in terms of information dissemination. Indeed, not only have social media platforms expanded the communication space, they have also made it difficult for regulators to censor the news. Most people obviously welcome and indeed celebrate, this apparent freedom. In expressing their satisfaction in this regard, social media enthusiasts often argue that the tools have revolutionized the socialization process. For instance, people have been known to make new friends and reunite with old ones just after opening social media accounts. Certainly, there is a lot to be said about this capacity of social media tools to connect and reconnect people. It has also been suggested that social media tools have radically transformed the way we conduct business. For instance, the tools can be easily used to advertise products and services at little or no cost. The tools have therefore made it unnecessary for business people to set up office spaces where customers and clients can meet them. Another dimension to this is that products tend to be much cheaper since the cost of office space would have been eliminated. Social media tools have also been used to provide humanitarian and emotional support to people in need, whether as individuals or as a group. For example, appeals for support have been successfully made for ailing public figures and some ordinary members of the public. In fact, in some of the cases the money realized ran into millions. Similarly, people contemplating suicide who dared to voice their frustration and intention online have been known to have received calls and messages which helped to change their minds. Nothing could be more soothing than when they know that thousands of people out there, some of them totally strangers, actually care about them and want them to stay alive and realize their potentials. It is even more soothing when those who lend them support confess that they have walked that path before. No doubt, they are more persuaded by words of advice from such people. However, it is also clear that social media tools have done considerable •harm to social relations. It is not uncommon to hear or read of cases where unflattering pictures of people have been maliciously released to the public via social media platforms. Social media tools have also been used to scam unsuspecting contacts on a person's social media account. In addition, they have been used to peddle sheer falsehood about others, among other negative practices. Whichever purpose for which anybody may use social media tools, it is clear that they have become an indispensable part of contemporary life.",
