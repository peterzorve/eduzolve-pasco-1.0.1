passage: "The two friends, Kosoko and Zotolo, relaxed comfortably in the minibus apparently free from all worldly cares. Their cherished dream of visiting home was becoming a reality. They planned to lavish expensive gifts on their loved ones in order to put smiles on their faces. The road passed through a thick forest and was devoid of all traffic. The two friends, alarmed at the reckless manner in which the driver was speeding, huddled together. They requested to get off the bus at the nest village, but the driver turned a deaf ear to them. Rather, the vehicle shot through the town at top speed. At that moment Kosok and Zotolo realized that they were in trouble. They talked to each other in whispers, anxious and uncertain about their fate. They attempted to open the door and jump out of the moving vehicle, but found, to their shock and dismay, that it was securely locked. At about midnight, the driver stopped at a junction which was believed to be a haven for hardened criminals. The two friends were ordered to alight and surrender their mobile phones, money and other valuables. A warning shot was fired to enforce compliance and suddenly, a gang appeared from nowhere. The leader of the gang, a mountain of a man, said fiercely that if Kosoko and Zotolo played any tricks, they would have themselves to blame. They obeyed without the least hesitation, but the ruffians still rained insults and blows on them. Suddenly, they saw a car moving towards them at lightning speed. It screeched to a halt and its powerful headlights dazzled them. At a signal, the attackers hurriedly entered the bus and sped off with the mysterious vehicle in hot pursuit. Kosoko and Zotolo, badly shaken by this terrible experience, painfully picked themselves up from the ground and ran towards their village. A blessed thought entered their minds that they should pass through the Osapa forest. This worked because soon after, the attackers drove back in a futile search for them. The two friends arrived home at dawn empty-handed but safe and sound and narrated their ordeal to their relatives. It was learnt later that the tyres of the robbers' vehicle got burst and they had to abandon the booty intact.",

passage: "Morality, good manners and intelligence are the key to success in any business. Moku was endowed with great intelligence. The future held a great promise for him. At school he was brilliant and passed his final examination with flying colours. However, Moku was plagued by some undesirable traits in his character; he was prone to bouts of anger and was ill-mannered. After school, he succeeded in setting up a publishing house which flourished because work of his hard and the huge sums of money he sank into the enterprise. As his business experienced a boom his products sold like hot cakes. His name became a household word. It was at this crucial time that Moku's ill-manners began to come to the fore. Maybe his success got into his head and he would not take the advice of his managers nor draw on their expertise. Even when his workers had good suggestions for improvement, he would not listen, but treated them with disdain. Gradually he began to sink under the weight of his own bad behaviour. He lost his customers and his profits dwindled. Consequently his publishing business almost collapsed. He learnt the bitter lesson that because of his wrong attitude he was filling his mind with negative emotions, such as, suspicion and hatred. He also lost the respect of his workers because he often quarrelled and fought with them. Fortunately, Moku realized his plight and was determined to turn bis life around. He joined the Praise and Worship Sanctuary and began to turn over a new leaf. His golden opportunity came one day when he met two foreign businessmen who showed interest in his publishing industry Impressed by his knowledge and expertise, the foreigners formed a partnership with him and his publishing business began to grow again in leaps and bounds.

instruction: "8. Read the following passage carefully and answer, in your own words as far as possible, the questions on it.",
passage: "There is joy for every married couple when they are blessed with a baby into the family. Howe  nurturing a child into adulthood is not the only responsibility of parents. In order to bring up a  child that one would be proud of, discipline is very essential. Disciplining children is a difficult task  that needs to be done with care. Before punishing a child for wrongdoing, a parent should make an  effort to find out why something happened the way it did. This is the right approach one should  adopt if the disciplining process is to work effectively. One of the serious mistakes which parents  make is for them to think that only one partner is solely responsible for disciplining the child. So the  other partner will look on unconcerned even when the child is doing something wrong. If the  disciplining machinery is to work well, this should not be so. Discipline is a joint venture which  both parents should handle together. If a parent does not allow the partner to have control over the  child whatever disciplinary measure, he or she adopts will not be effective. When a husband and  wife come from different backgrounds, they are likely to have very different views and methods  about discipline. At times, these differences can even cause real tension in a family. Parents may  clash over how to train a child. Unresolved disagreements over the disciplinary procedure can  become a wedge that drives a couple apart and create an opening for a child to play one parent off  against the other. There are some workable principles of discipline which can be applied to deal  effectively with the problems of training children in a disciplined way to become responsible  citizens. Certainly, parents need to invest time in the training of their children. This is the best  foundation upon which to build discipline. To prevent children from going wayward, parents  should regularly set aside some time to spend with their children. Admittedly, making such time is  not always easy, but it is worth the effort. Probably, one of the most effective ways is to set noble  and laudable patterns of behaviour for the children to follow. In order to bring up children to be  good adults, they should be made aware of the importance of discipline. Then they cannot turn  round to kick against set standards. It is right for parents to present a united front in disciplining  their children. Then the children will know that their parents will not compromise on standards of  good behaviour There is no doubt that these measures if properly executed will make children  conform to acceptable standards.",
