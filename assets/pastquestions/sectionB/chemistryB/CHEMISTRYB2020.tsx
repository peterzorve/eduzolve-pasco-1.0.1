instruction:  "All your burette readings (initial and final), as well as the size of your pipette, must be recorded but no account of the experimental procedure is required. All calculations must be done in your answer booklet. \nA is a solution containing 5.00 g of HNO3 in 500 cm3 of solution.  \nB is a solution of NaOH of unknown concentration.",

question:  "1a. Put A into the burette and titrate it with 20.0 cm3 or 25.0 cm3 portions of B using methyl orange as an indicator. Repeat the titration to obtain concordant titre values.  \nTabulate your results and calculate the average volume of acid used.  \nEquation of the reaction is HNO3(aq) + NaOH(aq) → NaNO3(aq) + H2O(l)",
