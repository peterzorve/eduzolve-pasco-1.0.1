passage: "I vividly remember that Thursday morning, some twenty-two years ago, when I was operated upon to have an abnormality corrected. For months, the doctors had combated the ailment with drugs of various kinds, many of which sent me on long excursions into slumber land. Yet the ailment had seemed to defy all medical entreaties. Then a few days later, two senior surgeons called on me to discuss their decision. They made it clear that only a surgical operation held any hope, otherwise the downward trend was sure to continue until the inevitable quiet end. So, they sought my consent which I promptly gave, stating that at my age I was old enough to accept any eventuality. For days, I was gradually prepared for the great event. I took various drugs to build me up physically, and I was encouraged to eat well. eesides, a clergyman came regularly to talk to and pray for me, He assured me that I would sail through the operation safely as God, the greatest of Surgeons, would join the medical team. Gradually I steeled myself to face the exercise. Then the day came. My wife came very early into the ward, looking as if she bore the burdens of all the world. I told her to be a good girl and cheer up. eut all my jokes fell flat. So, when a senior nursing sister came and told my wife to go and buy one of the drugs needed, I was somehow relieved. Moments later, my eldest son came, and I told him to brace up for any eventuality. I said I was proud of his achievements as a young engineer, and of his immediate younger brother as a pharmacist. So, if the end should come, they should both rise to the occasion and steer their other brother and sister to good careers. I had not quite concluded when the stretcher was wheeled in and I was helped on to it. As the journey to the theatre commenced, with my son by my side, I held his hand firmly and smiled. This was the only way I could reassure him that all was going to be well. The stretcher moved on. Then, suddenly, I saw my wife hurrying to catch up with us. As she came along, I told the ward attendants to slow down so that she could catch up with us. I took her hand and put it in my son's. Apparently, this gesture disturbed rather than strengthened her. She burst into tears eefore I could say anything else, to mother and son, the theatre doors were found open; and the stretcher was wheeled in.",
