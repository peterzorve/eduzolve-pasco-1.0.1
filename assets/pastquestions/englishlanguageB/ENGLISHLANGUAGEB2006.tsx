section: "SECTION B COMPREHENSION",
passage: "Answer all the questions in this section.\nTraditionally, libraries were large collections of books. Many people in institutions, offices and even individuals still keep and maintain such libraries. Today's libraries form a vital part of the world's system of communication and education. Unlike traditional 1ibraries, they have a wide variety of other materials that communicate, educate and entertain, made available through books, films, recordings, video tapes, photographs, computers, etc. This is a store of knowledge that has been gathered and kept through the ages. People from all walks of life - students, lecturers, businessmen, lawyers, doctors, research workers all use library resources in their work. Other people also turn to libraries to satisfy a desire for knowledge or to obtain reading material to occupy their leisure periods. One Professor Curtis said Development is impossible unless formal education is accompanied by leisure-time reading. Libraries also play an important role in have special collections of such preserving a society's cultural heritage. Some libraries items as rare books or works of local artists, music, portraits of important people and stool regalia. Many libraries, too, mount exhibitions and offer programmes to help people learn more about their community and its culture. The inclusion of such materials in the library's collections reflects the efforts of libraries to keep pace with changing information systems and to serve people in as many ways as possible. With the high cost of books, the library becomes a place where students can consult reference books and borrow some of the required textbooks, if they cannot buy their own. To the teachers, libraries could help them prepare reading lists to support their classroom and research work. Yet many students still consider libraries solely in terms of storybooks. If you asked them, 'Why do you read storybooks?' they would invariably answer, 'Oh, just for pleasure' or 'to improve our proficiency in the use of English.' Most students, unfortunately, fail to appreciate that reading storybooks enables them to imbibe useful bits of information unconsciously and effortlessly. This special benefit is invaluable. Perhaps one of the most valuable benefits of reading stories or novels is the appreciation of 'a proper sense of acceptable values.' One may learn through reading that respect for time is essential to success in business and in life in general. Such appreciation might help us bury the idea and attitude of the so-called 'African punctuality.' Unlike most modern movies that tend to play tricks on viewers' emotions and desires, good books are concerned with serious and important moral issues. They teach as they entertain readers: they prove that evil characters eventually do not end well and that the good almost always get the last laugh.",

passage: "7. Read the passage carefully and answer the questions on it.\nThe class ranged itself loosely in a semi-circle around the demonstration platform. Their official age was around sixteen though, in fact, it ranged from Kojo's fifteen years to one or two boys of twenty- one. Mr. Abu, the laboratory attendant, came in from the adjoining store and briskly cleaned the blackboard. He was a retired sergeant, feared by the boys. If he caught any of them in petty thieving, he offered them the choice of a hard smack on the backside or of being reported to the science master. Most boys chose the former as they knew the matter would end there with no protracted interview, moral recrimination and entry in the conduct book. The science master stepped in and stood on his small platform. A tall, thin, dignified Negro, with greying hair and silver-rimmed spectacles. Vemier was his nickname as he insisted on exact measurement and exact speech, 'as fine as a vernier scale,' he would say, which measured things in thousandths of a millimetre. Vernier set the experiments for the day and demonstrated them. It was a simple heat experiment to show that a dark surface gave out more heat by radiation than a bright surface. During the class, Vernier was called away to the telephone and Abu was not about, having retired to the laboratory for a smoke. As soon as a posted sentinel announced that he was out of sight, pandemonium broke out. Some of the boys raided the store. The wealthier ones swiped rubber tubing to make catapults and to repair bicycles and helped themselves to chemicals for developing films. The poorer boys were more determined and took only things of strict commercial interest which could be sold easily in the market. They emptied stuff into bottles in their pockets: soda for making soap, salt for cooking.... . Koio's cowardly conscience goaded him to protest, which he mildly did. 'Oh shut up!' a few boys said. Sorie, a huge boy who commanded respect and some leadership in the class growled, 'Look here, Kojo, you are getting out of hand. What do you think our parents pay taxes and school fees for? For us to enjoy-or to buy a new car every year for Simpson? The other boys laughed. Simpson was the European headmaster feared by the small boys, adored by the boys in the middle school and liked by some of the senior and African masters. He had a passion for new motor-cars, buying one yearly. Come to think of it,' Sorie continued, 'Kojo, you must take something yourself, then we'll know we are safe. Yes, you must, the other boys insisted. Kojo gave in and, unwillingly, took a little nitrate for some gunpowder experiments which he was carrying out at home.",

instruction: "8. Read the following passage carefully and answer, in your own words as far as possible, the questions on it.",
passage: "What is special about tycoons? What distinguishes the men who run major companies from those who never reach the top? Tycoons differ from one another in many ways. They occupy the entire spectrum, from extroverts to recluses, from free-spenders to tightwads, from charmers to bores. But they do have many qualities in common qualities that anyone who seriously aspires to be the boss must possess. It is well-known that long hours of hard work are required to reach the top. Probably most people assume that hard work is the means to an end, to success. But work can be an end in itself. Tycoons, by and large, are driven by a passion for work that is quite as powerful as any other human dive. Their work takes precedence over wives, children, vacations and hobbies. Businessmen who lack this overpowering drive will almost certainly be eclipsed by those who do have it. Tycoons cheer fully admit that they are workaholics. Robert Edward Turner III, the flamboyant young Atlanta entrepreneur, told an interviewer, I've provided for my family, but I'm still running. Why? It's fun. I couldn't quit.' Tycoons are often so intent on work that they look upon vacation as a nuisance. William Maquard, Chairman of American Standard, takes long weekends instead of vacations. 'After the fourth day I start to get itchy,' he said. The tycoon needs great energy to satisfy this passion for work. Many talented young businessmen have failed to get ahead simply because they were not built to take the grind. Thoroughbreds are bred to race. It's the same with people. It's something that's inborn,' says one tycoon. To confess fatigue is often regarded by tycoons as an admission of weakness or a lack of dedication. This can be a problem for subordinates', one tycoon admits. 'You think everyone's on the same wavelength as you are, and you find that you're wearing out your staff.' What else motivates successful businessmen to work so hard? Money may initially draw people to business but it is not what motivates them to reach the very top. Power is in some top businessmen are quite frank about their addiction to power, a word that does not sit well with the inhabitants of a democracy. The whole system of executive perquisites tangible evidence that the tycoon is someone special - is tailored to the tycoon's need for power. There are company jets to take him to the far corners of his empire and helicopters to fetch him from his summer home, if he needs a new suit or a haircut, the tailor or the barber will come to him. Tycoons are extremely competitive and take intense pleasure in winning. People who disdain or fear competition never get very far, because business really boils down to an endless series of hard-fought contests.",
