passage: "Breaking the news and asking for his mother's consent were more difficult than Badu had imagined. He had run out of excuses for keeping his mother in the dark. 'Today,' he mused 'I must let the cat out of the bag.' He gingerly knocked on his mother's door. There was no response and so he concluded that she was asleep . As he did not wish to disturb her, Badu decided to wait till morning. But as soon as he turned to go back to his room he heard, 'My son, come in. What's the problem?' Badu entered his mother's room. Strangely, all the well-rehearsed speeches, responses and apologies vanished. He could not utter a word. When Maame Pomaa realized that her son was not ill she relaxed and waited patiently for him to talk. Badu started b y repeating the conversation they had the previous evening about the Agricultural Ex tens ion Officer's visit. He then described Sister Afua's engagement ceremony which both of them attended two months earlier. Maame Pomaa listened patiently. She dozed off and was woken up by Badu's chuckle. Badu got up suddenly and told his mother that he was going back to bed. At the door, he turned, smiled and winked at his mother. She winked back. That was their usual way of saying good-bye. Back in his room, Badu could not sleep . His mind was in turmoil. This restlessness was mutual. Maame Pomaa, after tossing in her bed for a while, decided to return her son's visit. She tapped gently on the door. Badu jumped out of bed, dashed to the door and clutched his mother's hands . Maame Pomaa looked at her son closely and asked him to sit down. She sat by him and said calmly, 'Badu, I know you have something very important to tell me. Relax and bare your soul to me. Whatever it is, I'm sure God will give us the strength to bear it.' Despite his mother's encouraging words, Badu was still tongue-tied. His main worry was how_ his mother would react to the news. Being the only surviving child, he had been her only compaction since his father's death. Moreover, Maame Pomaa was not particularly sociable. How would she spend her evenings? Who would help her with her chores? There were some of the unanswered questions going through Badu's mind. He gazed intently at his mother and burst into tears. 'Maame,' he sobbed, 'I've won a scholarship to study abroad.'",

instruction: "7. Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions on it.",
passage: "Arna Atta used to sell cloth in a small shop in the market. Unfortunately, sales became so low that there were days on which she did not sell ev en a metre of any material. How could she and her children survive? A thought occurred to her. She must hawk her wares. Twice a week, she told herself, she would select some pieces of cloth, fold them, tie them up and, with a supporting pad on her head, carry them to buyers. At the end of the first day, she made quite a good sale. Incredible but true! She sold more than she ever did in the shop for a month. She was as merry as a lark. However, she woke up the following morning feeling exhausted and for two days she could not leave her house. On the third day, back to the shop she went. That day, the only people who came to her shop were two friends. They came, not to give her money, but rather to invite her to spend. One of their friends was celebrating a birthday and they must go 'in style', which meant buying expensive clothes and accessories . She did not receive the news with much enthusiasm. As a cover up, she told them that she could not attend the party due to a prior engagement. This did not go down well with her friends who left her shop without even saying good bye. She was upset but quickly pulled herself together saying, 'Life must go on. Today is the last day I' 11 go home without an income.' She went for Charity, a young girl who always ran errands for her. She often gave her good tips, so Charity was always at her beck and call. She got her interested in hawking cloth for a commission. Charity eagerly embraced the idea and soon other girls and even some women became interested. After all, hawking cloth is a respectable means of earning a living. In the course of time, Arna Atta had more than ten mobile retailers. She paid them well, and they were faithful to her; so both parties were satisfied. Of course, there were a few instances when 'smart' retailers tried to run away with the sales or increase the prices of the goods unduly. However, the eagle eyes of the others made them abandon their plots. Her shop soon became a wholesale outlet. She actually put into practice the adage, necessity is the mother of invention.",

section: "SECTION C",
instruction: "8. Read the following passage carefully and answer, in your own words as far as possible, the questions on it.",
passage: "Organized crime is a growing menace. The mass media daily report the unspeakable horrors of criminal activities. Crime involves not only the stealing of property and money but also, smuggling, kidnapping, rape and murder, as well as what is now known as internet fraud. Criminals will stop at nothing in their desperate bid to be rich at all costs. Indeed, the desire to become very rich within the shortest possible time without toil, actually makes people indulge in crime. Very often, the ostentatious display of wealth by the rich can influence the youth to take to crime. The increasing crime rate appears to be connected with the growth of cities and with development generally. While criminals wish to indulge in crime, they are afraid of detection and so they operate in large towns where they easily melt into the teeming crowd and therefore manage to hide their identities. For cities are so large and sprawling that it becomes easy for a crime to be at one end while the other provides a safe haven for criminals. The incidence of crime was less frequent in the past than it is at present. The causes of this difference in the rate of crime are many and varied. There are some people who relate crime to the cost of living. Where the cost of living is high, and many workers receive low wages, some are likely to consider crime as an alternative and even an attractive means of making ends meet. Inadequate remuneration makes people resort to all sorts of unapproved and anti-social ways to get rich. Unemployment forces people to move from the rural areas to the urban areas in search of jobs. In their bid to survive in the cities, some tum to crime. The desire to get rich quick, also makes people engage in acts like selling and pushing drugs. The sale of narcotic substances like Indian hemp and cocaine fetches huge sums of money. But even when the drug pushers have amassed wealth, they do not quit their evil trade; greed in their nature propels them on. There must be a decisive attitudinal change in today's society if a lasting solution is to be found to this menace. The permissive ways of our society seems to condone wrongdoing as the rich are accorded a lot of respect, no matter how they come by their wealth. Thus, our society has, regrettably, been harbouring criminals and this frustrates the law enforcement agents in their efforts to stamp out crime. The established laws are ineffective because there are loopholes in the legal structures. These enable criminals to wriggle themselves out of tight situations and continue to indulge in crime with impunity. Strict laws should therefore not only be enacted but also law-breakers should be punished severely to serve as deterrent to would-be offenders. Thus while crime in our societies cannot be completely eradicated, it can be contained even as our cities grow and expand",
