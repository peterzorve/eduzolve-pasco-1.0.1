passage: "For months, the robbers had ravaged the neighbourhood. One household after another had been visited by the gang, night after night. Soon, their strategy was almost predictable. They would announce their arrival with shots fired into the air and call on their chosen host for the night to behave himself by opening the door. Then they would cart away their loot just before the break of day. They generally did not harm anyone who cooperated with them. For three months, they paid their regular visits to the neighbourhood. Thus, Jagun knew sooner than later, he would be an unwilling host. He decided to prepare for their visit though when that would be called not say. He chose to take the things lying down, but he kept his strategy close to his chest. The robbers turned up at last. They called him by name and ordered him in his own interest to open the door. He hushed his wife and children and directed them to the toilets upstairs. This hack down the main door. He double-plated the metal door. The resisted them. Well, they had brought machetes and pickaxe. But their tools bounced off the door Jagun, then heard them deciding to make hole in the wall. So, he waited with a heavy, razor sharp axe for that action. The robber’s task with an old pickaxe and the machetes was tortuous one. At last, they made a hole large enough to let a human head in. Patiently, he waited. The leader of the gang decided to go through, but first, he had to clear debris of the broken blocks. As soon as his hand came through, Jagun hacked it off at the wrist, with one stroke. The amputated hand was quickly withdrawn. The mum kept mum. He announced that everything was well and that his second in command should follow suit, Jagun waited. And again a second hand hand came through with the same result. The handlers arm was quickly withdrawn. A third hand met the same fate. When the fourth robber, a young man, lost his hand, he screamed in anguish. The others tried to hush him up, but he cried the more. It was time to beat hasty retreat. By then, only the driver who was waiting in the get-away vehicle, was spared the gory ordeal. At daybreak, the police arrived at the scene and got enough information to hunt down the robbers.",

instruction: "Read the following passage carefully and answer in your own words as far as possible, the questions on it.",
passage: "Thousands of birds fly in the sky but the eagle stands out. It is different from other birds in many ways. It is amazing that there are more than sixty species of the bird. Apart from the vulture the eagle is the largest of all birds of prey. It has a powerful build, a very heavy head and beak. Although it is not an attractive bird, probably what has endeared it to man are its distinguishing characteristics. It is a symbol of courage, honour, determination and grace. That is why some great leaders emulate its qualities as a guide for good leadership. The eagle has unusual eyes which are very large in proportion to its vision is extremely keen and sharp. This enables it to identify not only potential prey but also its enemies from a very long distance. It has been observed that some eagles can spot even a small rat three kilometres away. No wonder, some people are said to be eagle – eyed. Besides its keen eyesight, the eyesight, the eagle is known for its fearlessness. It does not surrender in the pursuit of its prey. It has remarkable hunting strategy. No matter the size of its prey, the eagle will put up a good fight. The bird has been observed to have captured goats that are larger enough in size than it is. A close observation has revealed that the eagle love storms. Like man, other birds run away from storms. Rather than avoiding storms, the eagle takes advantage of them to soar to great heights. It spreads its mighty wings and uses the current as a springboard. It is interesting to note that no other bird can fly as high as the eagle. Research has shown that the eagle can fly up to an altitude of 10,000 feet. Even at that height, it is so swift that it can land on the ground in no time. Indeed, most human beings desire to soar high like the eagle. The eagle nurtures its young ones to maturity. The other bird of prey pays more attention to its young ones than the eagle. It is true the eagle is aggressive but it is quite gentle to its eaglets. The eagle always builds its nest in high places where enemies cannot reach thus shielding its young ones. There is a peculiar way in which the mother eagle teaches the young one to fly. She picks up the eaglet with her beak, spreads her wings and flies high. She suddenly releases the eaglet and allows it to fall. In this way, the young one discovers the use of its wings. Quite unlike the other birds of prey, even though the eagle is carnivorous, it does not eat dead meat. It other words, it does not scavenge. It eats raw and fresh meat got from its prey. The eagle is indeed a unique bird that its greatly admired. It is not surprising that it is an emblem of many countries, organizations and groups.",
