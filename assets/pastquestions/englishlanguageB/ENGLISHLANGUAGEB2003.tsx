passage: "Among the giraffes, zebra and gazelles that roam the vast African savanna, perhaps the most remarkable creature is the ostrich. Standing about 2.5 metres tall and weighing up to 155 kilograms, the ostrich is the largest bird in existence. No one can fail to be awed and fascinated by the bird’s great height, powerful legs and beautiful fluffy feathers. Like the camel, the ostrich is tolerant of high temperatures and thrives in desert country. It also has long luxuriant eyelashes, which protect its large eyes from the dust of the bushveld. Its legs are long and sinewy and its feet are strong and fleshy. Seeing the ostrich strutting about in the open plains, observers are amazed at its agility and endurance. The ostrich is omnivorous, feeding on almost anything that creeps or crawls. It also dines on insects, snakes, rodents and most vegetation. Because of its great size and weight, it cannot fly. However, its muscular legs are powerful enough to make it one of the fastest creatures on earth. Running across desert country, it can attain speed of up to 65 kilometres an hour! This extraordinary swiftness and its long-distance stamina enable it to outrun many of the fastest four-legged predators with ease. The eggs of the ostrich are the largest in the world and can weigh up to 1.5 kilograms each. Prized for its size and delicious taste each egg is the equivalent to 25 hens’ eggs. The shell is hard and glossy and has a glazed porcelain-like finish. The empty shell is sometimes used as a container by Bushmen for storing water. \n\nIn the 14th century, ostrich feathers became highly valued by fashion-conscious Europeans. Yet hunting the ostrich was not easy, since the bird has very keen eyesight and swiftly flees from danger. Consequently, the ostrich was in no danger of extinction at that time. But in the 19th century, armed with modern weapons, hunters slaughtered ostriches by the millions. And today the noble ostrich has become an endangered species.",

passage: "Chief Ibezim and the District Officer were good friends. Ibezim was the chief priest of Ani, the earth goddess, in Ndiuzo, and although the District Officer was stationed in far-away Umueke, and the chief priest by his calling should not travel out of Ndiuzo, their relationship remained as solid as a rock. They became friends after Ibezim had testified before the District Officer in the land dispute Ndiuzo and Umueke. He was the only man to testify against his people in the dispute, and had struck the District Officer as an honest man who was telling the truth. That was what earned Ibezim the admiration and friendship of the District Officer. Consequently, the District Officer advised him to send his son to the new school and the new religion that held out so much promise of positive change in the future. And when the system of indirect rule necessitated the appointment of a Warrant Chief at Ndiuzo, the District Officer again promptly thought of his honest friend as the most suitable candidate. On the other hand, Ibezim’s testimony in the land dispute earned him the wrath of many of his own people. They not only held him responsible for their loss of the disputed land but also resented his friendship with the District Officer and his patronage of the new education and religion, which was threatening to erode the old ways of the land. Therefore, when the District Officer wanted Chief Ibezim at Umueke, and he sought to confer with his people on what to do, his detractors quickly turned their backs on him and left him alone in his dilemma. Some even secretly hoped that he was going to be arrested and detained. After a long period of hesitation, Ibezim finally decided to break with tradition and go to Umueke. The times were changing and he was sure the earth goddess would understand and condone his going away from the village. When he came back, those who had wished him the worst got the shock of their lives. They now had a new Warrant Chief to rule over them!",

passage: "The dramatic increase in life expectancy globally towards the end of the twentieth century has renewed interest among scientists and laymen alike in the subject of longevity and the aging process. This lengthening of life expectancy has been one of the greatest achievements of humanity. It was in recognition of this fact that the United Nations formally designated 1999 as the “International Year of Older Persons”. Demographers tell a surprising story: octogenarians and older people, instead of the young, now form the fastest-growing population group on earth. What then are the factors that determine man’s health and the length of his life? Recent studies have identified some of these. It is known that the sounder your habits the longer your life may last. Nutritionists have told us that we are what we eat, that is to say, that what we eat influences the state of our health. Instead of over-eating, one should eat a balanced diet including fruit and plenty of vegetables. Moderate physical exercise on a regular basis is of immense benefit. The family doctor should be consulted on how much exercise and what type are most appropriate for each individual. Studies have shown that simple exercise in and around the home help the elderly to regain strength and vitality. The adage “use it or lose it” applies not only to the muscles but also to the mind. Mental exercise keeps the brain’s “telephone lines” alive whereas mental decline or senility starts the moment a person retires and decides to take things easy in the erroneous belief that he doesn’t have to keep up with the world anymore. Many retired civil servants fall into this bad habit. They can change this unhealthy habit by being actively engaged in reading, travel, education, clubs, professional associations etc. It is believed that such activities not only lift the spirit but also “rewire” the brain. In addition to these in the environment. In many developing countries, the environment poses grave dangers to health, often resulting in preventable deaths. Access to clean safe water is severely limited. There are huge mountains of refuse breeding vermin, cockroaches and disease-causing germs in both rural and urban areas. All this contributes to the low life expectancy in these countries. Better sanitation, safer water for all and a reduction of vermin in the home will improve man’s environment, bolster his health and extend his life span. The next factor is the state of medical care available in our countries. In the developed countries, advances in medical science have dramatically improved health care delivery. Unfortunately, the reverse has been the case in the poor countries of Africa and Asia. For example, in the USA, only one woman in 12,500 dies from pregnancy-related causes whereas one in 21 dies in Africa from the same cause! That speaks volumes about the deplorable state of our medical services. Finally, man has made a breakthrough in controlling his genetic make-up. A decade or so ago, he had no control whatsoever over his genetic engineering. Now, he can redesign his genetic constitution to ensure better health and longer life.",
